Arvind Sood: Thank you, (Marvin). Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call. The focus of our call today will be to primarily discuss our strong operating performance during the fourth quarter and full-year 2012. This performance is increasingly backed by diverse portfolio products. In addition to our strong operating performance, 2012 was characterized by meaningful advances within our pipeline, completion of important acquisitions and return of significant capital to shareholders. To discuss these topics in greater detail, I’m joined by several members of our leadership team. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will begin with a brief strategic overview. Following Bob, our CFO, Jon Peacock, will review our quarterly results and provide revenue and EPS guidance for 2013. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will then highlight our product performance followed by our Head of (Warranty), Sean Harper, who will provide a brief pipeline update. The reason I said brief is because we will host our business review meeting in New York on February 7th. At this meeting, we’ll discuss several initiatives and strategies in detail, notably our pipeline, which will be critical towards driving our long-term growth. We’ll use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results could vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.
Arvind Sood: Eric, I can give you a call after this conference call and run through additional details if you would like.
Arvind Sood: Thanks very much, Sean. I think that’s a great place to end this call and continue the discussion when we see everybody at the business review on February 7th. I want to thank all of you for your participation this afternoon. If you have any follow-on questions, of course, myself and the rest of the investor relations team will be around for several hours. Thanks again.
Tony Hooper: Thanks, Jon. So we delivered strong performance in 2012 despite increased competition, intensified macroeconomic pressures and access and reimbursement challenges. Our product sales grew 9% for the full year and 11% for the fourth quarter. Our commercial team remains focused to navigate the changing environment, build the right strategies and execute them as we embark on 2013. I look forward to discussing these challenges and opportunities with you in greater detail at our upcoming business review on February 7th. Let me now review our product performance for the fourth quarter, which is shown on Slide number 8. Starting with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN, I’d ask you to remember that Neulasta represents about 80% of the full graphic in sales. Sales declined 1% globally on a year-over-year basis but let me speak to the sequential trends for a moment. NEUPOGEN sales were flat as compared to the third quarter and Neulasta sales were down 5% driven by a 3% decline in unit demand.
Tony Hooper: So while the (SBO) estimates that provisions to the SRD bundle payment system could save about $4.9 billion over 10 years but legislation of course does not explicitly direct (CMS) to remove the $4.9 billion from the payment system. Importantly, (CMS) is allowed the opportunity to conduct their own analysis and the legislation then directs (CMS) to use the most recently available data on average sales prices and changes in prices for drugs and biologics when the agency refaces the ESR (DPPS). I’d remind you that (AP) levels have been reduced to about ($10.7) and we’ve seen it stabilize at this level for the past few quarters and we do believe that further reductions would increase the number of transfusions. As regards to Sensipar, we do not believe that the current treatment patterns with Sensipar will be impacted by the delays of (inaudible). We will have and continue to encourage the appropriate use of Sensipar.
Tony Hooper: So as I said earlier, in the EPO market, we’ve really seen a stabilization of dose with hemoglobins stabilizing around ($10.7). So we haven’t seen any dramatic changes in either dose or size of the market for some time now. The 2% sequential decline in the fourth quarter was fundamentally all around competition but, as I said, we exited the year still in excess of 96% market share, so we continue to believe that the (inaudible) see the true value and benefit of EPOGEN based on this long history in the marketplace around both efficacy and safety. Aranesp as well, as you know, probably 65% of our business is outside the US. But, again, that continues to be fairly stable in terms of quarter-by-quarter performance with some competition coming from the side. But the actual market in terms of usage or dosage appears to be fairly stable.
Tony Hooper: So the market going forward fundamentally has a (inaudible) as a competitor and we have not predicted any dramatic changes in the makeup of the market. Obviously we take every competitor seriously. We have long-term conflict with (Aveda). We have non-exclusive conflict with (Frasinius) in the marketplace and we have a highly experienced team out there every day talking about the benefit and the longer-term experience of EPOGEN. Let’s move into XGEVA and as we approach the patent expiry for the (subchronic) acid, we expect there will be some temporary disruption in the marketplace both as a result of competitive activities and some reimbursement considerations. But we continue to be very confident on XGEVA’s superior clinical profile and the benefit that it actually delivers to patients.
Jon Peacock: Yes, I think, Robby, I’ll talk in more detail about that when we come to the February 7th review. I think the focus – two things I’d remind you of, one is we’ve said that we would return on average at least 60% of net income to shareholders and we’re certainly well on track to doing that. And what I’ve said as going forward now we’ve completed the $10 billion share repurchase program, the focus will shift more to continuing to deliver meaningful increases in the dividend and I’ll elaborate more on that when we get to February 7th.
Jon Peacock: No, it’s essentially the profit share falls away. We pay the royalty stream which declines over a three-year period and we would expect the net benefit to be about $800 million in terms of operating profits. Next year, we’re happy after the call to take you through the specifics of that if there is some gap in how you’re looking at it but those are the two components.
Jon Peacock: I think to be clear, what I said was that for 2015 we expect revenues to be at least at the upper end of that $16 billion to $18 billion range and to be at least $8 a share. So I think we have positioned those as floors and business will progress and we’ll work against those floors over the next couple of years.
Robert Bradway: We were seeking really an industrial platform to become the industry leader in using human genetics for target identification and validation, and they were really seeking a way to see the enormous way of discoveries that they are engaged in right now translate into impact on patients and through the development of new medicines and I think the sum of the parts is much greater than the individual pieces.
