Warner Baxter: Brian, I think as we think about that extra $1 billion, obviously we are pursuing changes in the Missouri framework that would allow us to actually move forward with those to the extent that we have the opportunity to make those investments for the benefit of customers. What we will do Brian, at that point is step back and look at our overall capital plan, assess and reassess what we have got in that plan and also step back and reassess our financing. So I think it’s premature that we would need to issue any additional equity or that we would issue additional equity. We will take a step back and look at our overall capital expenditure and financing plans. Of course, we do have a very strong balance sheet today. And we have very strong credit metrics relative to our ratings. So we will assess all of those things as we move forward to the extent we have that opportunity.
Warner Baxter: Hi Brian, this is Warner. Couple of comments, yes, in December, three bills were filed. Senate Bill 190, which we spent most of our time on, but then there are two other bills Senate Bill 214 and Senate Bill 215. Senate Bill 214 really is very similar to the performance based rate-making bill that was filed last year and then Senate Bill 215 is similar to what I would say enabling language. Our focus right now and those in the industry is on Senate Bill 190. We believe when you take all the stakeholder input that we have had since last session and even in this session, it reflects many of the inputs that we have received from stakeholders and so that’s our focal point now. Those other two bills are still out there, but we are focused on Senate Bill 190.
Warner Baxter: And so look, I am going to turn it over to Michael Moehn who overseas our Missouri operations. Michael, you can comment a little bit about the process the commission has gone through in the past and then sort of where we are at.
