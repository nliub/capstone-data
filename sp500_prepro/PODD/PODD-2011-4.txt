I’d also like to remind you that the guidance we are offering today represents a point-in-time estimate of our future performance. You’ll find a link to the webcast of this call, as well as to today’s press release, at myomnipod.com in the investor section. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Duane. 
Brian Roberts: Yes, that’s all pretty accurate. I think they came in right around that $12.5 million number for the quarter. Overall, I think pretty much what we expected. We did go through a lot of the [indiscernible] in the last couple months of the year, integrating their distribution center and the like, so I think pretty much -- pretty in line with what we thought. For their growth going forward, still believe that they’re going to be in that kind of low teens type of grower for organic growth in 2012. So you pretty much hit it on the head. 
Brian Roberts: Sure. It’s a full year of the amortization expense now of the intangible assets that we acquired as part of the deal. That’s approximately about $8 million or so per year, a couple of million bucks a quarter. Stock compensation expense probably in that $8 million to $10 million range as we kind of forecast out what we think our equity needs will be for employees and new hires as well as just obviously what’s vesting over time. And then the rest is primarily depreciation expense. So that’s really the breakout of the three. 
Brian Roberts: Sure. So, again, I mean at this point here, as you’ve seen really throughout 2011, and we’ve been kind of in this range right now of 42% to 44% or so as we integrate in these full quarters of Neighborhood Diabetes, we start to ramp up a little bit on the international side as we start to launch the next generation pod over there. And just what we’ve been doing in the US business. As you guys know, we’re not really doing anything additional at this point to try to drive a lot of higher margin cost improvements around the current pod. We’re focusing all of those efforts onto the next-gen product. Certainly in the back half of the year, we think we’re going to start to see some of that gross margin ramp come through. It’s just a function of how many customers, how fast, convert over. As we said in the prepared remarks, we’re expecting to be able to move all of those customers over the last six months of the year. It’s hard at this point in time to really know exactly what that timing will be, and exactly how that will step through. So certainly as we go through 2012 and we get more and more clarity on that, we’ll be able to provide it. But I -- again, given the fact that in that first quarter we transitioned someone. We basically eat the savings by giving them a new handheld. I think it’s prudent to be able to expect that the margins will kind of hang in that range for at least the majority of this year and then as we really get to the last quarter or so we can update as necessary. In ’13, assuming we’re able to hit the goal of having everybody converted over in ’12, then we should see that step up that we’ve talked about, which is kind of 10 points or so out of the gate. And then as we sunset the current pod away, being able to get closer up to 15 points, which is really the equation, if you will, on a consolidated basis of just the 60% to 65% margin profile here in the U.S. coupled with the Neighborhood business and international. 
Brian Roberts: Yes. I mean, it’s working with all of the different endocrinologist clinics and making sure that they understand that we’re converting patients over and just making sure that, again, as Duane pointed out, once we’ve converted somebody over, the last thing we ever want to do is conver -- have to have them come back. So with that second line coming up at the end of Q2, we’re just trying to make sure that we have an appropriate amount of time to be able to convert all of them. 
Brian Roberts: On the Neighborhood side, I think what you can assume from that number is that’s basically kind of their organic growth rate. So that’s what we expect that business to do kind of sans cross-selling. You know, we’ve made a lot of progress on the cross-selling efforts of getting these different contracts modified to be able to allow us to do the strips. I think part of what we’re just trying to figure now is we’re testing at a couple of plans. We’re testing the sale and make sure it works here in the first quarter, first couple months of the year, to be able to then start rolling that out a little bit more broadly. So we’d expect that to be more of a back half of the year effort to start seeing some uptick. 
Brian Roberts: I mean, we’re certainly doing everything we can to make sure that people don’t wait for the next-generation OmniPod, right? I mean, again, it’s pretty simple. When we go to our sales force -- and we had our national sales meeting a few weeks back and talked to them at length about this. If a doctor -- if the endocrinologist believes that insulin pump therapy is right for their patient, there’s no reason to wait, because ultimately you’re going to receive this product. And so getting yourself on, getting yourself trained, being on the product for a period of time, it makes a tremendous amount of sense. And so that’s how we’re continuing to focus the sales force of how they go to the doctors as well as we’ve tried to do a little bit of -- within the compensation structure to make sure that they’re continuing to drive that way as well. So it’s an unknown for sure, but certainly we think we’re going to have good, solid growth in Q2 like we’d normally see in any other given year. In the back half of the year, with the transition, again, as Duane points out, it’s really a function of the manufacturing and making sure that we are at a point with both of those lines -- the second line coming up toward the end of Q2 -- that we’re comfortable with the level of quantities -- obviously the quality, to be able to transition everybody over. So to his point, I think we just want to -- we want to make sure that we're -- we’ve got that ready to go before we commit and say every single person is going to be transitioned, for example, in Q3. I think it’s going to take us more of kind of that back half of the year to get everything done across both Europe and the US. 
Brian Roberts: Yes, sure. I mean actually, if you look at the level of operating expenses -- and we said basically we think we’ll be about $30 million a quarter, which is really pretty much where we’ve been here in Q3 and Q4. So we’re not forecasting much growth in OpEx really from what the run rate has been over the last six months. The little bit of change does include the fact that we’ve got the couple dozen commercial folks coming into the building, as well as I’d say that there’s a few million dollars of one-time related expenses to really just kind of launch the product. As you can imagine, the development of marketing materials, building up some sample inventory, all of those different types of things that you need to do to be able to promote the product appropriately once approved is kind of one-time in nature. So that’s baked into the plan as well. Beyond that, as I talked about -- and we’ve had a little bit of an uptick in our noncash expenses, when we just talk about the amortization and the stock comp being kind of two drivers of that. So when you back all that stuff out, I think from an efficiency perspective we’re actually getting more efficient in our overall spend of our OpEx dollars. 
Brian Roberts: Yes. Again, in deference to them, we’re really not disclosing any of those numbers yet, but what I would continue to kind of point folks back to is our first couple of years here in the U.S. was a ramp from 4 to 13. The international market, the Ypsomed market, is kind of half or so what the size is. And they’re now getting into year 2. So maybe 1/2 to 2/3 the size is kind of the European market. So I think similar to levels of growth as we probably saw in the U.S. is realistic for that business. 
Brian Roberts: Yes. So China. We’re still working through the regulatory process at the moment, so we don’t really have a good updated timeline of exactly when that will launch. But we’re still working hard on it. We’d love to get it done here in 2012. In Europe, as we’ve talked about, I think overall Ypsomed’s done a great job of being on or ahead of plan. In all the markets they’ve launched in, with the probable exception of France, which wound up with a couple of reimbursement challenges that were unexpected originally, we actually had some folks over there last week working with the Ypsomed team to be able to try to knock those barriers down and get that going over the next few months. 
Brian Roberts: Yes, attrition effectively remained flat with Q3. We’re around -- we're in that 9% to 10% range, but I’d say we’re rounding down to 9%. And for Abbott revenue, we don’t talk about customer account numbers more broadly than talking about on this call that we’re nearly 35,000 now globally. But I would tell you that the Abbott revenue in the quarter was between $1.5 million and $1.6 million. 
Brian Roberts: Of the 65,000-70,000 customers they have today, probably 18,000 to 20,000 of those kind of fall into that insulin-dependent category. I don’t have the specific number of Type 1s, but I tell you it’s probably 90%-plus of that number. Overall, I mean I would think that just about all of that group would effectively be eligible for pump therapy. The only caveat is some percentage of those people -- and I don’t know the number offhand -- would probably be of Medicare age, which obviously wouldn’t be something that we’re covered for at this time. 
Brian Roberts: Well, I mean again, I mean I think if you’re thinking that we ultimately are going to push through 10-15 points of additional margin, the addition of some sales force, we’re just going to ultimately get that leverage or a good chunk of that leverage based off of that. Frankly, it’s no big secret. I mean, the struggle at the moment to be able to kind of push it over the goal line is just that consolidated margin of the business. Gross margin of the business is in the 40s, and to be able to push that into the 50s, it’s going to give you a significant piece of leverage. I’m not sure there’s much around changing the selling cycles per se, except for our teams are certainly doing a lot more on trying to concentrate on I would say the top 50 to 60 endocrinologists within their territories, because obviously that’s where we know that we can push through a lot more volume in a much better way. We’ve seen plenty of data internally for example that shows as we continue to penetrate clinics versus the one-offs, we can convert at a much higher rate. So that’s the goal, right? I mean, ultimately, as you find folks and you get those referrals in, you want to convert as close to 100% of them as possible. 
Duane DeSisto: 2011 was a strong year for Insulet. We grew the top line by nearly 60% as our US team continues to produce at a high level and accelerated our penetration into key international markets such as Germany, Netherlands, and Switzerland. We made significant progress towards the approval and launch of our next-generation OmniPod, and we are positioned to ship the product to Ypsomed by the end of the quarter. We added significant capabilities with the acquisition of Neighborhood Diabetes, and completed a two-year effort to restructure our balance sheet with the successful refinancing of our convertible debt in June.  As we look into 2012, I’ve never been more enthusiastic and confident about our prospects as we change the game again with the anticipated approval and launch of the next-generation OmniPod. And with that, operator, please open up the call for questions. 
Duane DeSisto: Yes. I think, Kim -- I think from our standpoint, right, the uncertainty here is while we are compensating the sales force and pushing them to go forward and continue to sell the current product, we also wanted to bake into guidance some of the uncertainty with people knowing about the new product getting closer and closer, and what that could all be. And like I said, I think from our standpoint we’re pretty excited about it, but we also wanted to be cautious enough, a little bit, on the top line in terms of what could possibly happen in terms of people delaying, or what goes on in this whole transition period here. It’s the first -- kind of a first time for the company. 
Duane DeSisto: So once we start shipment to Ypsomed, I think what you can read in, we’re comfortable with the quality and the quantity. It has all become predictable off that first line. And we know we can satisfy all that, and we’ll continue to push forward. So -- and I think we’re there. It’s the same thing. We want to do it day in and day out so it becomes a very predictable number for us in terms of what we’re doing. And like I said, Charlie’s pretty much been two weeks there and two weeks back here, continuing to push this whole project forward. 
Duane DeSisto: Sure. Look, I think we’re going to exit the quarter -- the projected production, that first line, is a couple hundred thousand, and we know we can make improvements to get it up higher than that, but I think we’ll be in that ballpark there. Pick a number, from 50,000 to a couple hundred thousand coming off of that thing a month. 
Duane DeSisto: Okay, so let me say this. I’m not going to predict when we’ll get approval, but I will tell you the nature -- the nature of the questions does not involve any more work. It’s more clarification of reports, and we submitted some data. They want a synopsis report on this thing, so we’ve got to get that out to them. So it’s not going back to square one at the moment. And like I said -- and I think I told everyone when we got that first round of questions, the thing that was pretty encouraging to us it was pretty thorough. So when we looked at those questions there’s not a segment of our submission that you said I can’t believe we didn’t get a question on. I mean, they had gone through this thing pretty thoroughly, and we were pretty happy with the responses. We think we gave them a thorough response. The nature of the interaction with the agency at the moment is more clarification and looking for a particular report. Not that we -- the data? I think the testing data’s all there. But they’re looking for kind of a summary and synopsis on what this testing data in particular means. So it’s more along those lines. It’s not, "Go out and put it on another hundred patients." It’s none of that. 
Duane DeSisto: And Ben, just so everyone believes that they’re going to be treated fairly, I think the way we look at it is, if you think about it sometime in the quarter your reorder comes in. So sometime in the quarter -- if we were to launch it right at the beginning of the quarter, you can make the argument that you could probably get everyone converted because everyone would probably place an order in the quarter. But you know, we’re kind of looking at these quarterly reorders as a clean way to explain to people how they’re going to get the next-generation pod. Right? What we don’t want is two people living across the street from one another and one gets it and the other one doesn’t get it and they think that there’s some duplicitous plan here to keep them on the old one. So that’s what we’re trying to time, and like I said, we want to do it clean. We want to do it orderly, and we want to do it simply so we can clearly articulate that. So if that means we’ve got to hold off a few weeks until we’re comfortable that the manufacturing can support that plan, we’ll hold off a few weeks. I mean, for us, the real key is to exit 2012 with this group converted and then we can sit here and start dialing in these 10 to 15 point margin savings that we believe are there with the next-generation product. 
Duane DeSisto: I think in terms of the sales force, and I’ll let Brian articulate on the Neighborhood piece, but in terms of sales force, I think that commercial -- the commercial selling organization will go -- I think we’re talking about that thing going up by more than half of that group that we’re adding here. I don’t have the exact number, so -- but I think that'll put us -- I think we’ll get 102 people between CSs -- and not including management -- between CSs and direct selling. And we’re talking about somewhere in the neighborhood, as far as commercial selling people out there, we're talking about more than half of that growth coming from that. 
Duane DeSisto: So look, I think there’s multiple pieces to this question. I think from our standpoint if we received FDA approval tomorrow, I mean, that’s just a milestone. The real critical thing before we transition anybody is we have to have a good handle on the manufacturing. So to use your example of the second line doesn’t come up on time, then we’re just going to delay the transition. We’ll put a date out there saying, "Starting with reorders in," -- if it was really messed up, "Starting with reorders on October 1, we’re going to transition people." Whatever that date is. Because what we don’t want to do is do this and then say, "Uh, yes, we can’t do it." Right? So I think our level of confidence is pretty high. I mean, we are now - every day that goes by we’re getting more and more experience on these machines. I would tell you I think -- if Charlie were here I think he tells you he feels pretty good about it, but it’s still an unknown. Look, until you -- well, one of the -- the key item -- we have a lot of IP. I think we have a lot of know-how. The thing that’s the toughest thing to do for anybody getting into this business is making millions and millions of something. We have a lot of experience. We think we should simplify the manufacturing process, but as we’ve proven, since the time we started selling product back in 2006 is every time you rev the engine another time you’ve got to sit there and make sure nothing falls off here. So I think we have a plan that will have that line up and working in sufficient time. So we can stress test the hell out of it. And that’s the plan. So that’s why we feel pretty comfortable about it. But until you do all that, I can’t sit here and tell you we’re 110% confident. But we have a very high degree of confidence, because we’re making 22,000 to 25,000 pods a day on the old line, and we think this line is simpler and easier to use. But until you make them, it’s just theory. So that’s how we’d play it. If we did have an issue, we’d have it. We’d give a date that’s a little farther out, and then we’d go forward. The other thing we’re obviously going to do, and you’ll see that in the back half of the year, we’re going to build some real inventory before we start the launch so I always have a cushion. So if I think -- if -- no matter what. Even if I’m 110% confident in Charlie and the team, we’re still going to carry more inventory than we typically carry just to buffer any hiccup that we have there. That’s the other solution for us. It would be a good use of cash in the short term. 
Duane DeSisto: So, great question. And I’ve talked to the board about it. I mean, we’re really pretty excited about what we think we can do with Neighborhood. And I’ll tell you this, their disease state management and the potential outcomes of what they do, we believe we can drive clinical outcomes. And the loyalty that their customers have to them by just pinging them once a month and how they go about doing this, we’re pretty excited about it. We’re also pretty excited about working with a -- we're working with a couple of physician’s office now. Because we have home delivery, we can run some tests on these patients. We can help the doctors immensely in terms of treatment and therapy and where these guys are going. So we’ve done a deep dive in all the clinical data they had. We think we have a couple of potential white papers that are pretty compelling on what we can do in terms of reducing healthcare costs for some of these people. So I would tell you I think -- I’m very, very excited. I think on the flipside, I think it’s like anything else, right? Doing the integration was probably more complicated than we all hoped, but we managed to get through it. But it probably took -- the flipside of the coin was it probably took a little more time and effort than we had ever anticipated. But like I said, that’s now in the rearview mirror, so we’re pretty excited about the opportunity, and we think we can roll it out outside the US and continue straight across the country, and really make it kind of an outcome-driven business. 
Duane DeSisto: I think -- yes. We typically don’t give starter kits, but I’ll let Brian comment on the retention. I think we’re still running. We've been -- the attrition rate’s been somewhere between 9% and 10%, and not a lot’s changed there. 
Duane DeSisto: I think there’s a couple of pieces here. Once we start cross-selling, and you start taking a look at the potential volume discounts and what we can do for some of their suppliers, we think we can improve the buying here. They have a bunch of stuff here in the next couple of months, just contracts that are coming up for renewal, so we think we can put some leverage on that based on the increased volume. The other thing we’re really really looking at -- and this probably wouldn’t be in terms of percentage of margin, but really margin opportunity. They have this pharmacy, which for Neighborhood’s been an incredibly underutilized asset, and we’re spending a lot of time looking at all the potential avenues we can have with this pharmacy and the other things we can potentially pick up. So I think we got a -- I think we have a couple of real interesting opportunities, and then I said -- in terms of kind of bottom line operating profit, if you take a look at this, once we start cross-selling and the pods start going out with a box of strips or insulin or whatever else a Type 1 diabetes patient may have, the incremental cost to us is nothing. For instance, if I put three months’ worth of strips in a box, it doesn’t even change the postage. So the guy has to walk a couple more aisles down and throw it in. So I think from a leverage standpoint, we think we can improve there very, very dramatically here. Like Brian said is we have a couple of plans that we did all the contracting. We’re going to do the cross-selling and billing here, and we’re going to watch it for a couple months, because what we don’t want to do is - the devil’s always in the details with managed care. So you don’t want to roll this all out on a big basis only to find out that you didn’t dot the i and cross the t and you can’t collect on all this. So we’re rolling that out now. We’ll watch that for the next couple months here and then we’ll start accelerating from there. 
Duane DeSisto: Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today. 2012 should be an exciting year for Insulet, and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress. Thanks.
