Robert Durian: Yeah, from an equity prospective, we're obviously sharing with you what we're doing in 2018 with no plan changes at this point. We were going to continue to evaluate what the regulatory decisions are. At this point, we're expecting a decision from both of the two major jurisdictions probably sometime in the second quarter following that, as well as any additional information we learn about our capital expenditure plan through the decision we're waiting for the wind plan. We'll probably have some information I would guess in a month or two to give you some more clarity as to what our equity needs look like beyond that at that frame.
Robert Durian: Probably sometime later this year, Andy. We obviously need some additional information regarding what the regulators are going to decide on the Tax Reform benefits from the timing and method which they are going to go back to the customers. And then also, we want to have more clarity on the capital expenditure plan which we're hoping to get here in the next few weeks regarding the second 500 megawatts of the wind in Iowa.
Robert Durian: That is correct. Yeah, right now as we disclosed on slide six of the supplemental slides, we see some I would say modestly accretive impact of Tax Reform on our earnings, but not enough for us to change the 5% to 7% through 2021. And that's largely centered around, we do like most utilities we're going to see some additional rate base growth, but we also see some additional equity needs and therefore they offset each other.
