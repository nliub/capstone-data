Robert Durian: Yeah. Just maybe to quantify the impacts, so through the first half of the year, the weather impacts on our sales or temperature impacts on our sales are about $0.05 to $0.06 positive and so that’s what’s really pushing us to that upper half of the range.
Robert Durian: Yeah. Michael, this is Robert. So you should think of us as right now when you think about 2021 we’re probably lower in a range of credit metrics, largely because we’re refunding a lot of tax reform benefits back to our customers in this timeframe. That’s scheduled to sunset towards the end of this year into 2022 and so we’re expecting over time those credit metrics to improve when we go through 2023, 2024 timeframe. So we’re well positioned to maintain our current credit ratings, and if anything, I see some optimism as far as increasing credit metrics over time largely because of the cash flow improvements that we see in the future.
Robert Durian: Yeah. Think of us right now in the mid-teens for the most part, like I said, a lot of that will be improving over time as we get into 2023 and 2024, even until the latter part of 2022. So like I said, we feel well-positioned for where we’re at with our credit metrics and credit ratings currently, and improving environment going forward. But think of us in the mid-teens now with things getting better over time.
Robert Durian: There wasn’t specifically in our regards, but we are, so we’ve identified the 5% to 7% over the long-term, I think through this point, maybe through 2023 and we’ll refresh that when we get through the November EEI conference, that’s our normal protocols. We easily add another year into the process when we provide additional CapEx for another year and rate base for another year to support that.
