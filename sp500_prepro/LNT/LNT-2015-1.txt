Pat Kampling: Yes, sure. Brian, I would say that those two decisions are independent. We issued NRP right now just because some attractive pricing and wind, in Iowa. And we thought we are just filling the portfolio for our Iowa energy needs. We still are evaluating a long-term needs when these PPAs expire, that's still announces that we are providing, but we have just taken the opportunity of low cost wind right now at Iowa.
Pat Kampling: Yes, we do have price holders in the current budget for additional wind facilities, but its years out.
Pat Kampling: Right now, we are just experimenting. We have -- we are putting solar across the property to really find out how to integrate in a cost effective manner with our electric distribution system. So this will be the first year that we are going to lean, experiment and then we will see what lessons learned and what other opportunities we are going forward.
