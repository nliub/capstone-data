R. Milton Johnson: All right, thank you, Vic, and good morning each of you joining us on the call and the webcast this morning. Now this morning we issued our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings release. The release is consistent with the preview we issued on the 9th of January. I’ll make a few comments on the quarter and the year and then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter and 2017 guidance. We finished the year on a solid note with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totalling $2.206 [ph] billion a record quarter for adjusted EBITDA, exceeding our industry as adjusted EBITDA by 3.6%. For the year, we reported adjusted EBITDA about $8.216 billion up 3.8% over 2015. For the full year 2016 diluted earnings per share excluding gains and losses of sale facilities and losses on retirement of debt, and legal claim calls, benefit cost increased 23.6% over full year 2015. 2016 was the year in which we performed well and light of just for comparisons to prior year growth performance. We executed our growth agenda effectively in 2016 as we continued our focus on adding access points to our network, broadening service line capabilities and expanding debt in clinical service offerings. Our growth agenda has delivered consistent performance. In fact, to illustrate the company has reported same facility admission and adjusted admissions growth for nine consecutive years, ER visit growth for 10 consecutive years and surgical growth for three consecutive years. We believe our strategies will continue to be effective and position us well for the future. WE believe investing capital in our existing markets is the key component of our growth strategy. In 2016, we invested $2.76 billion in capital expenditures for expansion of services and capacity in our large fast growing urban markets. And as you may have noted in our guidance issued this morning we expect to invest approximately $2.9 billion in 2017. Moving to cash flow, we generated $5.65 billion of cash flow from operating activities in 2016, up 19.4% over 2015. In 2016, as Bruce will mention we invested $2.7 billion in capital expenditures, we distributed $434 million to non-controlling parties producing free cash flow of approximately $2.5 billion. We returned $2.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases which resulted in HCA repurchasing about 36.3 million shares of our stock or approximately 9% of our outstanding shares since the beginning of 2016. On this subject of capital allocation, the company has not paid a regular dividend since its IPO here in 2011. And we have decided to maintain our current policy on dividend payouts. Although we remained confident in our long term growth prospects, we believe its’ prudent to take conservative approach and maintain maximum financial flexibility until we gain greater clarity of health and tax policies at the federal levels. Today, we believe share repurchase is the appropriate means to return free cash flow to shareholders, but we will continue to evaluate our policy overtime. I’d like to take a moment to comment on our recent settlement with the Healthcare foundation of Kansas City. The Missouri Court of Appeals recently reversed key parts of an earlier court's decision and confirmed that we spent in excess of $450 million during the five year term following our acquisition of the health Midwest Health system in 2030. While we disagree with the remainder of the Court ruling, we felt it was best to end this long standing dispute and we have entered into a final resolution agreement with the healthcare foundation of Kansas City. In the 14 year since our acquisition at Kansas City, we have invested over $1 billion in the market to expand and upgrade our facilities and add new services, and I’m very proud of the work we have done in Kansas City. I’m proud of the settlements and based on earlier court’s decision, the company had reported liability of $478 million. This settlement of $188 million brings a final resolution to this dispute and allows us to continue our focus on caring for the Kansas City community. I’ll close my comments with my thoughts on our 2017 guidance included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA growth, our guidance yield was approximately 2.5% to 6% growth for 2017. Our guidance reflects continued volume growth, reasonable pricing and well managed expense growth. I am looking forward to 2017 and I believe the company is well positioned to achieve its goals for the year. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill.
R. Milton Johnson: Yeah. We’re on cash flow. We anticipating cash flow from operations to range somewhere between 5.3 and 5.5 billion, will be down slightly from this year due to the some anticipated increase in cash taxes.
R. Milton Johnson: Yes. And Kevin, it’s Milton. You’re asking which one I guess its most important for emphasis health policy changes or tax changes and with respect to our decision around dividend payment, I’d say its equally driven, right now we need to understand how our dividends be tax in the future versus share repurchase opportunities and so you know, we’ll like to have some more clarity around that before we make the decision on a dividend and have a fixed charge on the company. Obviously health policy is something we’re concern about is well, and we’re following very closely in Washington. So, I can’t really, necessarily rank them because they’re both important into the decision around the dividend. I think with respect to opportunities for acquisitions in this environment, we do have a pipeline today, I’ll comment. I will comment that I think, I will also say as usual, its very difficult to know how some of the opportunities and discussions we’re having will actually turn out, but I will say that the pipeline today is little more robust than it has been in recent years and the transactions feel like they could be more realizeable and that’s just my kind of feel for the market right now. So, that’s a piece of it, but with our strong cash flow that we have and strong balance sheet, I feel like we’ve got the ability to remain active with the share repurchase program and to be acquisitive. So I don’t see a trade off there, but we would like as I said in my comments, we want to remain at this point conservative with our approach. We won’t maximum financial flexibility for the company to be able to take advantage with opportunities that could come in the coming few months or few years. So, we will as I said in my comments consider to evaluate our policy around dividends going forward is just in the current environment. We’d like to have more clarity before make any decision, that’s really a permanent decision with respect to the company’s use of cash.
R. Milton Johnson: Matthew, this is Milton and Bill maybe jump in, but we definitely believe that investor should be looking at EPS. We have been a consistent repurchaser of our stock. We believe we’ve create lot of value for our shareholders since the IPO. I don’t have number top of head, but billions of dollar maybe approaching not to $10 billion of share repurchase since the IPO. So we think that’s a very effective way also very tax effective way to return cash to shareholders and of course this does results in higher growth in EPS. So it is something we will like to investors to focus on with our current strategy. We think it’s a low risk, late to return cash and create value for our shareholders and so we definitely think that it should be metric that our investors should be paying more attention to.
R. Milton Johnson: I don’t know think that as we go -- of course lot of uncertainty with respect to our customers that I think what we feel replacement [ph]. I do believe when I think the management team here believe that there will be -- if there is a retail there will be a replacement. What that replacement will look like and how many lives it'll cover, it's been a -- we can't, we don’t know. But I'll say I don’t see it's going back up to the 2024 sort of uninsured volume lies and percentage is population uninsured that we had in 2014. So we had a long history of Brian of being able to react to the market place and to deal with changes in healthcare policy and this is one of the work through I am confident of that. And so I don’t see today any sort of changes and I think we have articulated that in our call this morning changes in our operations and our strategy around operations. We are moving forward. We are investing capital. We continue to see demand up in our markets. The exchange business is important to us, but it yet it only as about 2.5% of extra little volume. So we watched the market place very, very closely and to be able react to it when we see change coming. And this is one of the situations we are going to continue to do that. This next year we will be watching the market very closely as we get more clarity around how we think health policy changes if any in the next two, three years it will impact ACA. We will be very clear and articulating that to our investors and trying to quantify any potential impact. But today we remain very optimistic with our guidance for 2017 and then we will have to see how things work out later in the year. 
R. Milton Johnson: So let me -- well first of all we don’t believe that inpatient utilization is declining we think ACA market is growing because of population trends, because the aging of the baby boomers the kind of clinical technologies, all those things that have been driving demand historically are going to drop demand in the future at least in the intermediate run we believe that clearly we had a five and six quarters cycle that was accelerated demand that we experienced tremendous volume growth that part of the comparison challenges that we had in the past year. But we have seen a sort of normalized where we believe the markets are going to yield inpatient demand growth of roughly 2% across our market. As far as any managed care activities I don’t think that there is any unique managed care utilization management initiatives or care model initiatives that are impacting the market in any significant way. Possibly on the fringes [ph] here they are not anything at its core and how it's impacting overall demand, nor we see that in the short run to intermediate run either. So those two dynamics aren’t really evident across ACA's market. With respect to our capital and some of our initiatives that amount of money is travelling in throughout the year. It feathers in in 2016, a lot of our projects come in online at different points of 2017, 2018, and so forth. So is difficult to say that there's a bolus that's going to hit in the last half of the year for the first half of the year that's going to change our volume prospects. It tends to feather itself into our overall capacity and opportunities over sort of a consistent kind of timeline where just happening from month to month to month. And so we're not anticipating anything unique. As far as changing our model and approach to the prospects for growing uninsured, this past year our uninsured activity was flat to down. I think Bill, in total...
R. Milton Johnson: No there are several offers to try to adjust that, but it does not have a material impact on HCA or inside our guidance for 2017.
Samuel Hazen: Good morning. Let me began by giving you some of the volume stats that are normally provide on these calls. Once again in both the quarter and the year the company had broad-based volume growth across our market and across most of the facilities in service lines that make up our business. For domestic operations on a same facility basis, eleven of 14 divisions had growth in admissions in both the quarter and in the year. Non-division had growth in adjusted admissions in the quarter and 13 divisions had growth in the year. 10 divisions had emergency room visits growth in the quarter. Free standing emergency room visits grew 11% and accounted for approximately 60% of our overall ER growth in the quarter. Hospital based emergency room visits grew 0.7% in the quarter. In the year 13 divisions had emergency room visits growth. Inpatients surgeries grew 1.7% in the quarter, surgical admissions were 28.1% of total admissions in the quarter. Inpatient surgical volumes were particularly strong again this quarter in cardiovascular orthopaedics and neurosurgery categories. For the year surgical admissions were 28.3% of total which is an increase over the prior year. 10 divisions had inpatient surgeries growth in the year. Outpatient surgeries were slightly down in the quarter about 0.6%, hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes decline 0.5% and volumes decline 0.7% in our free standing ambulatory surgery division. Seven of our divisions in a quarter had growth in outpatient surgery volume. In the divisions that were down multiple service lines accounted for the decline. For the year, outpatient surgeries grew 1.2% with a 11 divisions showing growth. Behavioral health admissions grew 0.8% in the quarter and 2.2% in the year. Rehab admissions grew 5% in the quarter and 3.3% in the year. Deliveries were down 1.8% in the quarter and down 1% in the year. Again most of these declines were in Medicaid payers. Neonatal admissions increased 0.5% in the both the quarter and the year. Cardiology procedures grew 4.7% which is generally consistent with the growth rate for the year. Trauma volumes grew 18% in both the quarter and the year, observations visits were up 2.7% in the quarter and it grew 7% in the year. All-in-all the fourth quarter in 2016 were solid periods of growth for the company and they continue to show as Milton said a consistent pattern of growth over many years. We believe our strong portfolio of markets and favorable trends within them should yield overall demand growth in the range of 2% to 2.5% per year over the next few years. Our approach to these markets remains the same as we strive to be the provider system of choice for patients and physicians, the improvements we have made in clinical and operational metrics coupled with our increasing capital spending position the company well from a competitive position and should provides the solid growth prospect in the future. The company has over $4.5 billion of capital in-flight that is just to hit our markets. This in-flight capital which is approved project that are not yet in service and should be completed over the next three years will add urgent care centers and free standing emergency links to our provider systems allowing us to improve patient access and experience with more conveniently located facilities. Additionally, it will increase capacity in existing hospitals by adding more inpatient beds, emergency room beds and operating suites thus relieving constraints in many situations. And lastly, it will enhance service line offerings with new equipment in clinical technology which will provide a better environment for nurses and physicians in delivering care to our patients. In addition to capital spending our growth agenda includes coordinated marketing strategy, patient care coordination systems and multiple human resource programs that are particularly focused on physician developments and nursing operations. This agenda is supported by strong execution systems and resource by the unique scale and operational capabilities of HCA. In sum, we believe we continue to have solid growth opportunities across our diversified portfolio of market and services lines and we believe our local provider systems are well-positioned to capitalized on these opportunities in the future. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.
Samuel Hazen: Well, there’s has been significant movement across our markets where payers entering the provider space. Optum and United have made a couple of strategic acquisitions, but they’re sprinkled from one market to the other and they don’t really have what I call it concentrated influence on any one particular market. Obviously, we see opportunities for us to work with the payers as they try to build out providers assistance because what we’re doing as an organization and we’re having discussions with the payers around using our network and our footprint in these areas to accommodate their objectives and we think there’s a lot of opportunities there for HCA and other payers to accomplish that. But we’re not seeing any significant competitive dynamics to-date nor we see it in the foreseeable future coming from those strategic move across the markets, again, within a particular market there could be a bit of concentration around that, but we had some of those situations in the past in markets already and we seem to be able to work with the payers or around the payers in those emphasis to accomplish what we need to get down in those individual market.
Samuel Hazen: In general I think it's more of the later than anything else. There hasn’t been a significant amount of new supply Ambulatory Surgery Centres across our markets. We do have some under this movement our physicians from centre to the other that sort of typical we've had pretty good growth of trend and are able to towards surgery centre division, as well as our hospital based outpatient units over the past few years, but the last two quarters has been a little softer than we anticipated. We do have had company's division showing growth in an half that are down with a variety of reasons driving some of the declines in some of the markets. I was still bullish on both components of our outpatient surgical initiatives. We are investing in capacity in those areas in some markets, we are adding technology and others, and we continue to work with physician to create the environment that they want for their patients. And I anticipate that we will be a back to our normal growth period, our growth trend over the coming periods.
Samuel Hazen: The market share data that we have, which is most current is through the second quarter of 2016. Our overall market share is flat. So we have seen some pressures on our overall market share where we are flat at around 25% for that 12 months, period ending second quarter of 2016. I think there are two issues for overall market share being flat. One, we have seen increased competition as I have mentioned in the past in the form of new facilities in a lot of our markets both on the in patient side and the outpatient side and we can point to that as a fairly significant contributor to some of the pressure. And then the second point which cause right back into our capital discussion as we do have significant capacity constraints in a number of our facilities that are poised for growth. I understand we get this capital along, we think that will open up some market share opportunities for the company. On a commercial side, we have seen a little bit of drop in our market share, it's isolated to a handful of markets, but they happened to be big commercial markets for ACA where we've seen an accelerated level of competition in some of these suburban markets where there is density of commercial lot. We have what we think our responsible strategies for dealing with that that’s where urgent care outreach, some of physician imitative and markeing strategies, we think are going to help in that particular funds, but it is quite competitive on the commercial side in many of our markets.
Samuel Hazen: Okay, this is Sam again. On labor expenses I’m really pleased with how the company was able to manage it for labor expenses this year. We saw the modest productivity improvement which I think is somewhat of a reflection of the operating leverage that we have from the volume growth. We were able to moderate our contract labor growth for the year. It was only up 6% for the quarter, it was up 4% nursing continues to be a challenge for the company but we are making progress with a number of our initiatives around on boarding nursing, around training nurses, around recruitment in those areas and we still continue to manage that particular component of our expense structure effectively. The trends going forward are modestly under pressure compared to this past year we are expecting wages to be up a little bit, maybe 50 basis points over where they were but that’s embedded in the guidance that Bill gave. From the supply and other expense standpoint no significant inflationary pressures that we see at this particular point in those categories that will create any unusual risk in our expense structure for 2016. So we feel pretty good about where the company is. From that standpoint we have a host of initiatives underneath our expense structure that are driving toward efficiencies and we continue to evolve those, they center around better labor management approaches with one HR platform, our performance improvement change which we’ve talked about in the past continue to find opportunity to enhance processes in our facilities and efficiencies and in our clinical agenda it’s continuing to identify opportunities to improve supply cost utilization, blood utilization, better patient length of stay and those kind of thing. So the combination of those are still a positive opportunity for HCA and one in which we believe we can execute on and mitigate some of these pressures. Thank you Gary.
Samuel Hazen: Gary, let me take a shot at it but this is Sam and then Bill also may also have some comments on it. So our capital spending is really a direct reflection of the opportunities we see in the marketplace and demand that we see. Sam was talking about in certain markets if we don't invest and expand to add more capacity than our growth will be limited by lack of capacity. So we're trying to stay up to speed of that or ahead of that. And so we have been increasing our capital spend upto record levels. Quite frankly at the same time, as Bill mentioned in his comments we have been reporting and seeing a record levels of return on invested capitals as we’ve been spinning more capitals. So I think those investments have turned out to be very solid and good investments and value creating opportunities for our shareholders. Now if the marketplace changes, we certainly have the ability to ratchet down capital spending. And so we've been through different cycles before. When we went through the recession back in 2009, it takes a little while to ratchet down, because the project is in process, but we didn’t have the ability, and we demonstrated the ability to slow it down based on market needs, and the like. So and so I don't see today as being any different. So right now, we're seeing demand in our markets and we're investing too meet the requirements of that demand and again, I've been quite pleased with the return overall on the investments that we've been making.
Samuel Hazen: You are very welcome. I want to thank everyone for being on today’s call. We look forward to talking to you and seeing you soon.
William Rutherford: A.J. real quick on the cash overseas. We have had London international operations. We have approximately $400 million cash overseas that if there's an opportunity that would give us some opportunity to repatriate that, so we’ll just wait to see how certain tax policies may unfold to see how we deal with that progress
William Rutherford: It is an annual number. That’s on average, I mean, we have about 38,000 impatient beds that are operational, so the 400 or so that Milton counted, it’s a 1% increase in capacity and then our ER beds we have about 5,000 ER beds so if we’re adding 200 – 150 to 200 then next we’d get to the 4%. Its important to understand that our impatient bed occupancy for the company is at record highs, we’re operating over 70% in patient occupancy utilization on our operating beds. Our emergency room room that utilization is running almost 90% utilization. Again those constraints create some challenge for us in many facilities until our capital can get there. So that's where the numbers come from, Justin. Those are some of the metrics underneath that, and that's how we are thinking about the roll forward there. 
William Rutherford: I just agree with what Sam telling and I am looking here at our freestanding outpatient surgery growth each quarters. This is the first quarter we had negative growth in the line of 8 [ph] to Sam's. So we have been very consistent growth around, one just under 3% and first quarter of 2016 the manufacturing growth was 5%. So it's been a consistent grower for us. This is the first quarter that we had we reported negative growth in freestanding outpatient surgery next quarter. 
William Rutherford: Yes it did in discover [ph] it in line with our expectations. We said this is contributing 5% to 6% of adjusted EBITDA and that’s a double [Indiscernible] 2016.
