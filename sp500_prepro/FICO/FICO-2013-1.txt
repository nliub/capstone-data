Michael J. Pung: Yes, 31% to 32%, based upon the reinstatement of the R&D credit, which we will be able to claim here in quarter 2.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, when we guide -- let's start with your first question. It was accretive this quarter, both on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. The EBITDA margin was roughly in the low teens, and it was roughly breakeven, slightly positive on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, this was the first full quarter that we have had Adeptra rolling into our numbers. For the year, we gave guidance of roughly around $55 million for the Adeptra business. And we're tracking to either meet or beat that.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, we guided about 2% to 3% of organic growth embedded in our numbers, with the remainder coming from M&A. We basically guided an assumption that assumed that our Scoring business would continue to run flat with a little bit greater in the software side, similar to last year.
Michael J. Pung: A lot of the Blaze deals are either perpetual or term license. And so most of the deals, the bigger deals this quarter, were perpetual licenses. And the whip [ph], therefore, would be a result of the 2 big transactions that we did this quarter, in addition to kind of the standard book of business we do.
