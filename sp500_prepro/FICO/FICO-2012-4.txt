Michael J. Pung: Yes, Carter, so this is Mike. We're expecting Adeptra revenues to be on a full year basis next year around $55 million to $58 million. And we expect it to be GAAP accretive of around $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter, so about $0.09 to $0.10 for the full year. That includes about $6 million of incremental amortization expense related to the intangible assets.
Michael J. Pung: So what we're planning to and we have begun to put some dollars into [Audio Gap] R&D function, in particular adding some features and functionalities around our business on the mobility side, which is an extension of what we're doing with Adeptra. We're also planning to invest, and we have started to invest in some areas around our fraud products by expanding the capabilities within that offering set.
Michael J. Pung: We are very focused on taking our products and offerings and making them easier to implement and offering them on a SaaS basis. And so we're working our way to SaaS-enabling our product line.
Michael J. Pung: Yes, Marketing solutions revenue was up. I can give you a percentage. It was up in mid-single digit as we rolled on our new customer for the first full quarter. The third largest Retail Action Manager deal we did. Let me look and find the exact number. It's up roughly about 7% on a year-over-year basis, 4% sequentially.
