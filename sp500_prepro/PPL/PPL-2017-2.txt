William H. Spence: Thank you, Vince. In summary, we had another good quarter and PPL remains on track to deliver on its 2017 earnings forecast. We remain confident in our ability to deliver 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth per share from 2017 through 2020. As you know, we've raised the dividend 4% earlier this year and we continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% through 2020. We're executing very well on our low-risk business plans. And we continue to deliver for our customers as evidenced by our industry-leading customer satisfaction awards. With that, operator, let's open the call to questions.
William H. Spence: Yes. So that is one option, rolling forward the value into 2020 and beyond. But you are correct, if things stayed as they are today, with the forward curve being above our targeted budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound, we would be at the high-end of our earnings forecast. So you're absolutely correct on that. I would say that probably as we finalize our hedging for 2020, we'll be able to give a little bit more color around how we expect to use the value to the extent it continues to sit out in the forward years, and whether we're going to adjust our earnings forecast through 2020, or push that value forward into future years.
William H. Spence: Sure. Well, a couple of things there. One is, the tools that we've used in the past, I would say our tax planning and pension planning. So those are things that we've been effective at doing in the past. You mentioned shaping the revenue profile. That's something as we go through the consultation process, we'll look at how we develop our plan and whether that's an appropriate avenue to pursue as well. Vince, I don't know if you have any other comments around that and then, I can ask Robert as well.
