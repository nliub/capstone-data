Art P. Beattie: Thanks, Tom. For the third quarter of 2013, we earned $0.97 per share, compared to $1.11 per share in the third quarter of 2012, a decrease of $0.14 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we earned $1.41 per share, compared to $2.26 per share for the same period in 2012, a decrease of $0.85 per share. Our results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, include after-tax charges of $93 million or $0.11 per share and $704 million or $0.81 per share respectively, related to the increased cost estimates for construction of the Kemper project. As previously communicated, Mississippi Power will not seek recovery of estimated cost to complete the facility above the $2.88 billion cost cap net of DOE grants and exceptions to the cost cap. Year-to-date, 2013 results also include an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 include $21 million or $0.02 per share of insurance recovery related to the March 2009 litigation settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery, LLC. Excluding these extraordinary items, earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 were $1.08 and $2.24 per share respectively, compared with $1.11 and $2.24 per share respectively during 2012. Excluding the effects of Kemper County, the primary driver for our third quarter results was milder than expected weather, resulting in a decrease of $0.07 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Weather was actually $0.10 below normal, compared with $0.035 per share below normal for the same period a year ago. In terms of cooling degree days, the third quarter of 2013 was one of the mildest in the past 20 years. For instance, in metro Atlanta, where we would normally expect to see more than 100 hours of summer temperatures above 90 degrees, we saw only one such hour. In August, also in metro Atlanta, we experienced four straight days with average temperatures of 67 degrees, but even that doesn’t tell the whole story. Rainfall during the quarter across the entire Southern Company territory was at its highest level since 1916. The significance of this anomaly cannot be overstated. When rainfall is that heavy, the typical heat buildup fails to occur. Without this buildup, the temperature momentum that usually results in sustained electric demand for cooling never materializes. This factor greatly affects our earnings – greatly affected our earnings during the third quarter of 2013. It’s significant to note that weather affected not only our retail sales, but also energy sales to wholesale customers. We were able to offset the total effect of weather somewhat by reducing non-fuel O&M spending compared to our plan. A more detailed summary of our quarter-over-quarter drivers is included in the slide deck. Turning now to a discussion of our retail sales and economic outlook for the remainder of the year. GDP growth in the Southeast and the nation as a whole, remained slower than expected, at 1.5% to 2% year-to-date growth. However, in terms of jobs growth year-to-date, the region is just slightly ahead of the nation at about 1.7%. Industrial sales growth during the third quarter of 2013 was relatively strong at 2.6%. We continued to see emerging growth in housing-related sectors such as lumber, up 9%; stone, clay, and glass up, 7%; and textiles, up 6%. We also saw increased strength in paper, up 11%; petroleum up, 11%; and primary metals, up 8%. Exports have begun expanding again after a stalling in the first quarter. Weather normal residential sales were relatively flat for the quarter, although, customer growth is slightly ahead of the same period in 2012. As expected, residential sales growth continues to lag behind our customer growth. The commercial market continues to show signs of improvement as evidenced by a decline in office vacancy levels, which have fallen nearly 10% from their peak. Elsewhere, our economic development pipeline remains active and productive, as the Southeast remains a great place to do business. Currently, our traditional operating companies are supporting some 350 potential projects representing more than 40,000 jobs and $15 billion in capital investments. Meanwhile, recent announcements are adding nearly 7,600 new jobs in our territory, included among these are Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia; corporate manufacturer, Shaw Industries, auto parts manufacturer, Hyundai-Daimos, vinyl tile manufacturer, Mannington Mills; wood pellet manufacturer, Green Circle Bio Energy and medical software developer, iSirona. Now at this point, I’d like to share our earnings estimate for the fourth quarter of 2013, which will be $0.44 per share. This implies annual results at the bottom end of our guidance range. I’ll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.
Art P. Beattie: Yes. Steve, if we look at the project cost that we expect recovering on, it would be the basic $2.4 billion plant cost that we initially certified to, the cost of the man, which is about $250 million, the cost of the pipeline, which is roughly $115 million and then there are some other regulatory assets that we’re on Mississippi Power’s books that are scheduled to be recovered as well, that’s about $190 million. And that’s when we look at what would be within Mississippi’s Power earnings rate base, that’s what we look at. The other pieces of it would be AFUDC, which is roughly $425 million and then the difference between 2.4 and the 2.88 cap will also become part of the securitization package, that totals about $480 million. Those are the pieces that make up what we’re looking at, at this point, other than the write-off amounts.Steve I. Fleishman – Wolfe Trahan & Co: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Art P. Beattie: Well that they have – yeah, they’ve been moved to site, but they haven’t been accepted by us and from a quality perspective. Those elements that are still being remediated, are still being remediated under CBI’s oversight.
Art P. Beattie: Yes. I think when you look at our equity needs, we’ve outlined the need for equity a little bit more this year, total of about $700 million for the year and $600 million next year. 2015 is still kind of a toss-up, but as to whether or not we’ll need any is a function of obviously tax policy, with bonus depreciation that we qualify for all of that kind of stuff. but we may not need any equity, additional equity in 2015.
Art P. Beattie: I think it's also important to note that under Mississippi Law, as I understand it, that an assumption of prudence has to be made and that there has to be proof of imprudence when you go through the whole process. So it's something that's been clarified here as of late.
Art P. Beattie: Yes, Paul, we don't expect that they'll change from what we outlined on the last call. $700million this year, $600 million next and then 2015 will be dependent on other Southern Power projects or whatever, but right now, we may not see any need in 2015 or 2016, but we're still maintaining a target 44% equity ratio.Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then it sounds like you – subject to the purview of the board, but you see $0.07 dividend hikes, is that the way to look at it or is it a percentage increase we should think about. 
Art P. Beattie: Can you hold on a second? It’s about $500 million year-to-date. We need about $200 million more to get to our target. I think there is an appendix slide on the website, Ali that could give you that number as well.Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Got it.
Art P. Beattie: One of things about weather normal, and I know I’ve always said this is that it’s more of an art than a science, but weather this year has been so abnormal that when we do and I know our load forecast folks shoot arrows at me when I say this, but when our models try to normalize it is using modeling from normal weather years. So when you take an abnormal year like this and try to figure out the weather impact, we don’t think we’re getting reliable numbers, but – so we think our growth could actually be a bit better than what we’re reflecting.
Art P. Beattie: Yes, Michael I’m going to have to get back to you on that, I don’t have that detail, but we will be certainly glad to get you that information.
Art P. Beattie: Yeah, we are about half of that at this point, somewhere around the 450 number is my recollection anyway.
Art P. Beattie: Well, yeah Kit this is Art. You look at O&M and we have a hard time defining normal in O&M these days. As we look back in time and we just look at our operating company O&M levels over the last four years and if you normalize it for things like the Daniel lease at Mississippi, we’ve been relatively flat a non fuel O&M since 2010.Kit Konolige – BGC Partners LP: And how many assets have you added.
Art P. Beattie: And we have added over the $7 billion of plant and service during that time, including Unit 2 in Georgia around the McDonough, 2500 megawatts of natural gas units, we’ve added scrubbers and SCRs around the system. All of these assets require O&M. So we’ve been able to absorb that around the weather and economic impacts that we have suffered through for the last two years.
Art P. Beattie: As our comment, O&M comment. That may not be level across all our operating companies, you may see company increasing if their – for example Georgia Power putting the Vogtle 3 and 4 into service, you are going to see some elevated levels of O&M around the those assets.
Art P. Beattie: We’ll have some other milestones beyond that around reliable syngas out of each train, that’s a little bit far off so.
Art P. Beattie: Yes, hey Vedula I appreciate your interest in that kind of number, we’ll give you more updates in January. We’re just not prepared to go there right now.Vedula Murti – CDP US, Inc.:  All right. Thank you very much.
Art P. Beattie: We do the whole thing Paul, we started with the low forecast and then we put every piece together after that. So that the annual cost as we go through.
Thomas A. Fanning: Thanks, Art. There has been a lot of interest recently in the emergence of a changing trajectory in long-term earnings per share growth to our industry, we’ve noted that many of you are writing about that now. It has been our practice for the last decade or so, we will provide updated guidance range for 2014 and an updated long-term growth rate during our fourth quarter earnings call in January. It’s been an awfully busy year with a lot of important regulatory outcomes either pending or complete in all of our jurisdictions. For example, we expect the Georgia Power rate case to conclude in December. So there is still a lot of important information to be factored into our long-term EPS growth. That builds an interesting question, what do we think will remain the same and what do we think will change? While we don’t yet have the specifics, we can talk directionally. First, what do we expect to remain the same? Dividend policy, based on what we see today, we believe our dividend growth trajectory will remain consistent with the dividend increases of the past six years. Now dividends are ambiguously the purview of our board what we are confident in our ability to continue deliver those returns to our shareholders. Second, what is likely to change? The shape of our EPS growth, compared to the past 10 years, our EPS growth will likely slow a bit during the middle of the current decade, but will likely increase again, by the end of the decade. Why? Well, as you know, Southern Company has been investing capital at a very healthy rate for many years now, supporting major projects, like our McDonough Gas Units, Plant Vogtle, Kemper County, our environmental spend and growth at Southern Power. In fact, our CapEx as a percentage of our invested capital base has averaged about 8% over this timeframe. As we work through our annual update to the financial plan, this percentage is projected to become smaller through the middle of this decade, associated with this reduced CapEx and growth of invested capital is the fact that our cash flow metrics are expected to improve dramatically. In fact, within the next three-year period, our equity need could be eliminated or go negative in order to preserve our target equity ratio. And by the end of the decade, our growth in CapEx is expected to resume with the advent of more environmental spending and the commitment of our next phase of generating capacity for our traditional operating companies and Southern Power. : We are now ready to take your questions. So operator we’ll now take the first question.
Thomas A. Fanning: So the kind of primary focus is on the CA 20 that we’ve referenced. I think the important thing to note is that all of the material associated with CA 20 is currently onsite. Construction is progressing in an acceptable manner and like we said, we’re projecting the assembly of CA 20 would be done by year-end. That’s kind of most important, that actually forms a support mechanism for other modules, for example CaO-1 that will occur later in 2014.
Thomas A. Fanning: Hey, Jonathan.Jonathan P. Arnold – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon. Just to clarify, Tom, on these modules, last – I think the last update was some of them were still in Lake Charles. You are saying today, they are all physically in Georgia at the site.
Thomas A. Fanning: Yes. Let’s kind of go through that a little bit. early on, when we talked about, we did see weather being kind of the major thing. And I remember right out of the gate, we had some ambitious targets and right out of gate, we hit out targets and that – that’s the tone you were getting from them. As we progress on installing the pipe particularly, it’s almost hard to imagine unless you’ve been there, I know some of you have been to the site and you’ll now what I’m talking about a) there is a lot of pipe, b) there is different kinds of pipe, wide bore pipe, there is small bore pipe, some of the pipe is outside the physical structure of the gasifier island and the gas annealing system. Some of it is in constraint spaces inside the structure. Obviously, what we have found is the production levels that we saw earlier we’re not able to be sustained, because a lot of the work ended up being detailed work inside the structure. we just did maintain the kind of productivity that we wanted to see, further – and we kind of alluded to this, we are now with over two shifts of 2,000 craft people per day working on this issue. And to some extent, there is a saturation at the site, we don’t think it productive to add more people and add more shift and everything else. We’re kind of where we want to be here and part of changing the schedule; I suppose that we could have done more and try to keep May. But we felt that for the overall health of the project, it was important for us to take this new schedule, put people to work in a more efficient manner and get the work done. So it’s kind of all that combination and when we say, weather and rainfall and all that, I remember we were down there one day; we go to visit the site, a good bit as you can imagine. It’s not just rainfall, sometimes, it’s fog. And in fact you can imagine, big cranes working and manipulating some of the material on the site. if you can’t see the top of the crane, you can’t work.
Thomas A. Fanning: Let’s do the dumb math a little bit, real quick. Jonathan, I think it might be helpful. If you add together less than expected sales and lots of sales through the weather, we’re in $418 million range for the year, somewhere around there.
Thomas A. Fanning: And O&M is down a similar number over something like two to three years. So we have moved O&M and weather in concert to the extent we can. At some point, one of the issues that we face is – and Art loves to keep reminding me of this that something like if the past 25 months, we have had below normal weather or milder weather, 22 of the last 25.
Thomas A. Fanning: And therefore, I suppose we could just continue to take O&M out of business and I guess we could do that. However, that doesn’t really serve our responsibility of clean, safe, reliable, affordable energy to our customers. So we have to balance that whole equation. So look, we do to weather normal projections, we will do that. We need to restore some O&M to get back to other normal activities. Let me just – I’m dying to do it; I always love to do this lagniappe in this call. You all on the call are familiar with heating degree days and cooling degree days. You’re not going to believe the profile this year of Southern Company. If you look at the cooling degree days and heating degree days, for the month of January, February, March, June, July, August they were all about the same number. it is astounding the kind of year we’ve had.
Thomas A. Fanning: Yes man, we’ll update everybody. We’ll update everybody in January. What we were able to say here, because I know everybody is going to want another specifics, we’re just not ready to do specifics, we’ll do that January as we have for the past decade. But what we could say, in all the uncertainties, even now in our financial projections, we do have a – what appeared to be a dominant solution. The dominant solution basically says, sort of rate of growth of dividends, we think will be consistent with the past, putting in place all of the caveats about purview of the board and everything else.
Thomas A. Fanning: Well, the way you should think about that is that – what we try to say is, I’m going back to John Chiles, that old stuff. Those of you that aren’t old enough to know John Chiles, you ought to read his book. He is old guy on Wall Street, but your earnings per share growth rate for net growth and dividends per share at or above the rate of inflation, but we’ve been able to do with this tremendous growth period that we’ve had is increase our dividend. I guess, it’s the past six years in a row at $0.07 a year and what we’re saying here is by almost any measure we’re looking at, we can maintain that kind of trajectory assuming that the Board agrees and everything else, but that’s what we think. So you should think about earnings per share growth and dividend per share growth together and by saying, I think, we can keep that $0.07 trajectory going, I think, let’s say that whatever happens in the near-term is benefited in the longer term.Shar Pourreza – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay. Thank you so much.
Thomas A. Fanning: Well, again, it’s going to vary depending on the industry you’re talking about. I’d say auto transportation is going to continue to expand and I believe all of our manufacturers are operating two shifts five days a week, some more. We expect that certainly to continue. Primary metals has been kind of up and down depending on what the metal is being produced for. Obviously, automotive metal has been – demand has been pretty high, but construction materials and other steel related products has been – that might be elated towards the export market has been kind of spotty as well. Our chemical numbers year-over-year looked down and that is because one of our bigger chemical companies closed one of their processes here in Georgia and so yield at the end of this year that will be removed from the process. So you should see a continuation of pretty strong performance in the chemical side. And again, housing-related stuff is really off a pretty low base. So – but we’re pleased to see that they are improving. I think, Dan, it’s probably a mixed bag and it’s a little too soon for me to comment at this point, but we don’t see a wholesale slowdown in the industrials sector.
Thomas A. Fanning: Well, I'll give my shot at it. Art, give yours. I mean, who knows, number one, I mean, we've got to have the prudence review and we're giving them all the documentation and everything else. Certainly, we are disappointed with the additional charges that we've recognized and what we believe will be a future loss. It would be amazing to me for somebody to come up with an argument that for at least the first $2.88 billion that we are in prudent, knowing that we are writing off now on a pre-tax basis over $1 billion. I would find that a very tough argument to make.
Thomas A. Fanning: Sure, it's higher rate of growth compared to kind of the 2016, 2017 timeframe. It's going to be more like this, I think, when you look at the integrated resource plans across the system, kind of the next timeframe of new generation will be in the early 20s. So let's just say 2023. So getting ready for that, starting construction, all that, will be one. That's for our retail operating companies, further. Southern Power, the Southern Power people work really hard to produce results. When I think about Southern Power this year; last year, they made something like, I don't know, $175 million and we've given them a stretch goal to improve that this year. We think they've lost pre-tax something like $40 million on energy margins this year, just because the capacity factors of their equipment is lower, gas prices have gone up something like 80% off their lows, coal prices have come down a bit, especially as we shifted to western coal in the aggregate. So the other thing is we keep pushing Southern Power to go evaluate deals and go buy things that fit our business model. I can tell you, there is a lot out there for sale, but we are very disciplined and we have not pulled the trigger very much absent the solar deals we've announced on striking new deals. So we want to clear that inventory out of the way and accelerate Southern Power's own growth plan. We've also told you in prior calls that we're looking elsewhere, so Texas, MISO, PJM West, a variety of other things, where we might be able to find some more fertile ground. That also is a function of our reserve margins in the Southeast. The other thing I would just mention is environmental spend; particularly ash, water, what else is down the road. The new rules that we're looking at, particularly, for ash and water, are bigger in nominal dollars than our incremental MATS costs. So we think that as we find the firm dates in which we have to comply effluent standard 316(b), CCB, Coal Combustion Byproducts, et cetera, we think those numbers will emerge at the kind of back end of the decade. So we'll be spending money there. Those are kind of the big buckets; new generation, Southern Power, environmental spend.Daniel L. Eggers – Credit Suisse Securities LLC: Great. Thank you for that. I appreciate it.
Thomas A. Fanning: Yes, sure.Greg Gordon – ISI Group Inc.: Just a follow-up on that line of conversation on the – I take it you said earlier in the call that you would see sort of a dip in growth in sort of the 2016, 2017 timeframe and then accelerate back up in the back half of the decade and I just heard the answer to the last question, which put some more bones around that. If I look at Slide 14 of your slide deck, it gives us 2013, 2014, 2015 CapEx by segment. So is – what you're – is what you're telling us that your new generation and environmental compliance spending will see a dip in 2016, 2017, and then reaccelerate later in the decade, but that T&D, maintenance, [indiscernible] general, the other things are sort of steady as it goes? Is that the right…
Thomas A. Fanning: We hope we'll find opportunities. By definition, we're a big EVA company and if we can find things that fit our business profile, we're not going to change long-term bilateral contracts, no field risk, creditworthy counterparties; we're going to keep the course there.Greg Gordon – ISI Group Inc.: Right.
Thomas A. Fanning: They are precisely opportunistic. You're exactly right.Greg Gordon – ISI Group Inc.: Okay, Tom, thanks. That's very clear. Take care.
Thomas A. Fanning: We are still considering that. As of this point, we haven't made any commitments.Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much, guys.
Thomas A. Fanning: Yeah, and let me give you – I couldn’t agree more with, Art, here is one more. Normally, when you think about weather adjustments, you got the temperature. It is clear that the rainfall has had a significant wet blanket on economic activity. People are going out less, spending less. We’ve laughingly used in the past the traffic over the Pensacola Beach Bridge and beer sales out of the Walmart, people just didn’t spend as much money. Shopping is down. So…
Thomas A. Fanning: Yes. So there is a rainfall effect here, which is interesting, but we don’t capture that.Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Understood. Thanks a lot.
Thomas A. Fanning: We thought there would be more gas deals around when we looked at another biomass deal we looked at other stuff and we just had them like what we are seeing.
Thomas A. Fanning: So that would be it, the other thing is we are seeing lots of potentials outside the United States, and here let me give you kind of two factors. We continue to innovate around TRIG that’s the brand name of our technology and in fact there is this other technology we are working on, it’s just a natural evolution at TRIG where we might capture as much as 100% of the CO2. Now we are far from being ready for prime time there, but the linkage of CO2 not as a way for something a value particularly with enhanced oil recovery, they have some potential. And so we are continuing to work on it. So look, we are very proud of TRIG we made a mistake on the engineering. We agreed to price cap without having done fully our homework on the deal and we planned to work. But I think down the road we’ll find ways we think to the capital cost down and make the things economic. The other thing people talk about and what we’ll do is how can you do Vogtle? How you can Kemper with oil and gas prices well we have made probably the biggest shift in the industry from coal to gas. Southern Company is now the third largest consumers of natural gas in United States. Everybody knows I’m bullish on natural gas but we cannot put all our eggs in that basket. We must find innovative solutions to go forward okay. Final point, we are now engaged in some discussion around the world China, Pakistan, Indonesia, Australia, Poland. I’ll be in Washington on November 7 – 6, 7 with Secretary and other energy Secretaries from International companies talking about the applicability of TRIG or any improvements to TRIG that we make down the road. And think about it why it would it might make sense there rather than hear? Well, because they may not have advantages of natural gas industry that’s been created through fracking and so if they don’t places like China, Indonesia, Australia, Poland at all may have near-term uses for this kind of technology. So look, I guess to summarize quickly do more homework upfront understand the risk of a price cap it would be we are going to continue to innovate and we are very proud of this technology we think it’s got great promise in the future we are continuing to work on it.
Thomas A. Fanning: Dynamite. Good to hear from you.Kit Konolige – BGC Partners LP: Just a couple of kind of incremental bits of information when to go with that growth rate in sales, what’s your assumption about the kind of longer term five, seven years growth rate in O&M as you go forward.
Thomas A. Fanning: So let me just say it differently. So assuming, accounting for increases in assets, increasing the inflation, we’ve actually had declining real O&M level.
Thomas A. Fanning: Yes right, so that’s the obvious math right. And remember we said that EPS has a shape now, so we have a trajectory that you are going to be flattened a bit and then revamp. So remember where the payout ratio would rise in the time of flattening, you’re going to be much more cash flow positive. So from a credit metrics, cash flow covers or dividend or however, you want to think about that, we can sustain a higher payout ratio. So we wouldn’t be afraid at all going above 75, I don’t see any scenario right now credibly that would get us north of 80, but I think we could be in the 75 and north range. But I think that would be fine for us to I think longer term we would work it back down. It’s more important for us to have regular predictable sustainable increases in the dividend policy we understand how important that is to investors and I feel confident that we are going to able to sustain that assuming the broad goes along with that.
Thomas A. Fanning: No. We meet all the time on this stuff. You wouldn’t believe – I guess the between me and Mark Crosswhite our COO board members we go to NSRB Nuclear Safety Review Board where we go to each of our plants and evaluate all the details of the operations of the unit. Our OPCo CEO of Macquarie and Paul Bowers of Georgia, Macquarie and Alabama go these meetings. We have board meetings at Southern Nuclear, we meet all of time on these issues, as well at our management council meetings we evaluate kind of budget to actual performance and projections of all our business units including nuclear. While these are important issues that you are kind of highlighting here, we don’t think is a significant budget issue and we’ll be able to work through anything coming our way here. This is not one of the issues that’s going to be a driver to an investor’s decision in a material way.
Thomas A. Fanning: Hey, Mark you know what I would rather do here, I would rather gets you on a phone with some of our nuclear guys and talk about that, just talking about that in isolation really doesn’t tell the whole story. Remember we had the whole post Fukushima things and we are going to do hydrogen venting and a whole lot of other issues. I can just tell you looking at the budgets of our nuclear business they do grow, but its nothing that’s going to way down our ability to deliver financial results if you want a lot of detail I can put you with the right people.
Thomas A. Fanning: Okay, yes hi, Mitchell. We are going to probably want to get back to you on that by only sense could be that is kind of production and weather related as I described earlier on the call, but we’ll get you the specifics on that, you’re looking at a specific I think regulatory report, probably what you are looking at.Mitchell Moss – Lord Abbett & Co.: Yes.
Thomas A. Fanning: We’ll get back to you, call us back later and we’ll figure that out for you.Mitchell Moss – Lord Abbett & Co.: That’s okay and then on the upcoming milestones, there was previously you had said that this steam turbine synchronization was going to be at the end of October, so…
Thomas A. Fanning: Yes.Mitchell Moss – Lord Abbett & Co.: Okay so that’s being completed. So it looks like there weren’t any other 90 day milestones coming up or at least listed so are there – what should be paying attention to you know in your significant benchmarks.
Thomas A. Fanning: Yes, finish the piping [indiscernible] going. So going so far, it’s been going very well we’re 60% through start up something like that 50%.
Thomas A. Fanning: Well, no. there has always been a prudence review associated with the project. I guess as we outlined in our opening remarks, there is going to be one kind of in the spring of 2014 that will cover, I think through 2013. And then we’ll – through the March of 2013 and then expenditures beyond March of 2013 to in-service we’ll have another prudence review on that, that’s always been the case.Andy S. Levi – Avon Capital Advisors LLC: Okay, I apologize.
Thomas A. Fanning: I suspect that’s probably isn’t true for anything in the utility industry.Andy S. Levi – Avon Capital Advisors LLC: Fair enough. and then just the last question on Southern Power.
Thomas A. Fanning: Yeah. I said that before, we don’t believe in the merchant model, we think it doesn’t serve customer’s interest in the long run and our business model, remember is long-term bilaterals, creditworthy counterparties, no transmission or fuel risk, things like that. We’re going to stay on that case. that’s why we haven’t done a lot of deal, like I said, there is s lots of stuff for sale and we kick every tire we see, but we are very disciplined in what we’re doing. So the lack of selling and buying projects of Southern Power is not because they aren’t out there, because we don’t like what we see.Andy S. Levi – Avon Capital Advisors LLC: Great, okay. I’ll see you guys in a week. Thank you.
Thomas A. Fanning: There are days I ask myself I suppose, gee whiz, you have to put yourself in the contest of the time in which decisions were made. I think management at that time felt that there was pretty robust growth. A lot of the planning and all that occurred before the downturn in the economy and we were seeing pretty robust growth and so we have always felt about the broad portfolio, we felt that the nuclear program, which is actually going exceedingly well had the right supports in place to make it effective. And so my sense is around Vogtle 3 and 4 it’s a terrific project, its going along terrifically, we’ve had terrific support, support by the Governor, the PSC, the Legislature of the General Assembly in Georgia, the Administration in Washington, Congress, both was going great. The only kind of black cloud here is Kemper and I have said many times that while we are very proud of the technology that we developed along with our partner KBR, remember originally Kemper that technology was going to get built in Orlando, but it was going to get built without CCS, when we moved it to Mississippi we combined CCS with enhanced oil recovery. And we made a strategic mistake back then, we committed to do the deal with a price cap without enough engineering being done, that would be my sense of it. Recall also the state of Mississippi within an interesting position where failing to do Kemper County would have subjected them about, I forgot what the number would be 70% to 90% of gas for their electricity generation and from a public policy standpoint I think the regulator of Mississippi didn’t want to have that much volatility of energy production tied up in that fuel resource. There was a host of issues, but if you think going forward how well Vogtle was going, we definitely would take in our shots on Kemper. I think when you consider all of the efforts in Alabama, all of the other efforts in Georgia outside of Vogtle, all of what is going on at Gulf and really the work in Mississippi outside of Kemper. Southern is and Southern was. We continue to deliver value to customers everyday, products and reliability customer service. And I think if you want that underscore it is a notion that our customer value numbers had been terrific for a long time, we are the top four among the companies we survey. I don’t think Southern – I think Southern is going to be fine in the long run; its just getting through Kemper is the issue.Ashar Khan – Visium Asset Management LP:  Okay thank you.
Thomas A. Fanning: Hey Dan.Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: So just a couple here, you mentioned I think on Vogtle how you are in the final phase potentially these DOE loan guarantees.
Thomas A. Fanning: The equity is – the equity here has already taken place and we will replace the equity as we commence the additional capital that we’re investing in Kemper. So the additional $1.1 billion will be financed with a portion of equity from Southern and it will help restore by the end of 2014, their equity ratio to about a 50% or so level.Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: So you won’t try to do on the impeded capital structure, you’ll just use whatever happens to be with that hit that was basically taken by the shareholders for coming up with a cost of capital per rate making you are saying.
Thomas A. Fanning: That’s correct.Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay, that’s all I was wondering. Thanks.
Thomas A. Fanning: Good, how are you?Vedula Murti – CDP US, Inc.: I’m okay. You were talking a bit about the back-end of the decade and particularly in terms of place holders and CapEx the churn in cash flow. I’m wondering can you kind of maybe range off maybe over like the five year period 2016 through 2020 or whatever you feel like you can. What type of cash flow flexibility you think you are going to have over and above maintenance CapEx and everything like that and that might be available because it seems like that you have a chance depending that this might be a period of time that would kind of look somewhat similar to periods of mid 90s after you just completed Vogtle.
Thomas A. Fanning: Yes, the numbers we’ve given you are based on everything, every piece of information that we know right now. Essentially the information we’ve given you is consistent with the information that we’ve suggested in the past, that any schedule change is worth about $15 million to $25 million, if you just want to do—I always love kind of dumb math, simple math. $15 million to $20 million a month if you go six-month times $25 million to the $150 million and we’ve retained in light of that $100 million of contingencies. That’s how you get to where we are. Of the $150 million there’s still $100 million of contingency in there.Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates, LLC: Okay, but I mean in terms of just qualitatively speaking, one would think as time goes on and as you guys sort of reach certain milestones of what have you, that’s the uncertainty level would go down.
Thomas A. Fanning: So I see, I see.Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates, LLC: Do you see them sort of staying I mean or…
Thomas A. Fanning: It’s altogether.Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates, LLC: So it’s all of that, so is everything is really actually reviewed.
Thomas A. Fanning: Yes, I’m sure, I’m sure.Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates, LLC: Okay. So we’ll see what happens, okay. Thanks so much, all my other questions have been asked.
Thomas A. Fanning: Yes. I just want to say, thank you so much for your attendance on the call. We went over a lot of interesting territory. It’s a little unusual for us to talk about kind of longer term performance. But since it’s been such an interesting topic that many of your are writing about we felt that it was a good things to kind of highlight. We continue to work hard and making Kemper as successfully as it can be. We feel confident in our ability to execute there. Everything else at Southern is going well. When you look at Alabama, Georgia Gulf, the rest of the Mississippi when you look at our fundamentals Southern is performing as well as it ever had. We got to get Kemper build and operational and we’ll be in great shape. We thank you so much for your attendance this afternoon and look forward to talking with you soon in Florida. Take care.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Hey Tom, hey Art. Just one or two questions on CapEx, I’m just looking at the slide in the appendix from this quarter slide deck and last quarter slide deck. I want to make sure I understand what’s happening here, it looks like you moved CapEx up and into 2013 at Mississippi Power, but then you backed down the back-end numbers there and them at Alabama Power it look like you raised the back-end numbers, but lowered 2013. I just want to make sure I understand the drivers there and then I want to follow-up on Southern Power.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Also Southern Power, you had earmarked about $900 million of CapEx for 2013, we are basically at Halloween I just didn’t know kind of where are you in that run rate and is that a number that’s likely to come down and be a source of cash to the holding company in the next – as you kind of have to fund and burn, fund some of Vogtle.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Tom, you’ve made some comments about Kemper County and kind of that the engineering versus construction processes. Given the fact that its an innovative technology, if you were sitting down a year or two, three years from now with some your peers and had to give them – give like a lessons learned or if I had to do over what would I do differently type. What else, are there other things you would have done significantly different and I’m just really trying to think about this kind of longer term next 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, there is other companies in the industry have to do things that are technologically different than what they have traditionally done.
