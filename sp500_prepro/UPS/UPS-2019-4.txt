Scott Childress: Good morning and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are David Abney, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; Kate Gutmann, our Chief Sales and Solutions Officer; along with International President, Nando Cesarone; President of U.S. Operations, George Willis; our Chief Information and Engineering Officer, Juan Perez; and Scott Price, our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the Federal Securities Laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our Company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainty, which are described in detail in our 2018 Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. During the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. GAAP results included a non-cash, after-tax mark-to-market pension charge of $1.8 billion, an after-tax transformation charge of $39 million and U.S Domestic after-tax legal contingency and expense charges of $91 million, predominantly related to the New York cigarette case.  The after-tax total for all three items is $1.95 billion, an impact to fourth quarter 2019 EPS of $2.23 per diluted share. The mark-to-market pension charge includes the effect of notably higher than anticipated asset returns and the unfavorable movement to lower discount rates. It also includes an updated estimate of potential benefits related to the central states pension fund.  In the prior year period, the Company’s GAAP results included a non-cash, after-tax, mark-to-market pension charge of $1.2 billion or $1.42 per diluted share. More details on the mark-to-market accounting will be available in a presentation posted to the Investor Relations website later today.  Unless stated otherwise, discussion today refer to adjusted results. The webcast of today’s call, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures are available in the UPS Investor Relations website. Webcast users can submit live questions during the call.  We will attempt to answer questions of a long-term strategic nature. Callers are asked to submit only one question, so that we may allow as many as possible to participate.  Thank you. And now I’ll turn the call over to David.
Scott Childress: Our next online question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe, as well as a few of the other analysts. Please provide an update on your relationship with your major customer. There is always much discussion of their plans and how that could impact UPS’ business over the next few years.
Scott Childress: We’ll take another online question. There is multiple analysts asking this. Did – how did your peak season returns compare this year to last year? And please discuss UPS’ process to handle this.
David Abney: I certainly can. This is David and I would say, we are faster – fast-tracking initiatives in 2020. We have had positive momentum in 2019 and we see it in the underlying performance in 2020. We have clear visibility to structural shifts that we really want to take advantage of Next Day and Seven Days. And so, we just see tremendous opportunity especially with our SMBs.  So we have elected, made a conscious decision and we wanted to pull forward some transformation initiatives into 2020 that would speed up our network significantly and take advantage of these opportunities that are being presented. And so, we are focusing into – two main areas. Our time and transit, and we started improving time and transit, making it quicker in 2019.  We are going to triple that rate of improvement in 2020. In fact, the UPS network, we will be faster by the end of this campaign for 80% of the U.S. population than we were before we started. So, 80% significant improvements.  And then of course, weekend, seven day deliveries, just so important to consumers today and we are going to double our delivery volume and weekends on Saturdays, we are going to reach 40 million new consumers and what’s important is, seven days is important, not just for residential, but for commercial deliveries too.  We have SMBs saying what about us, we need seven day delivery and we are focusing in that regard too. And then, Sunday, we started out with an economy service that’s over the majority of the population and we are going to expand Sunday offerings throughout 2020 to give a wide, wide range of delivery options. So these are two structural shifts that we see that run hand-in-hand with our SMB strategy.  And the good thing about these is, they are not CapEx heavy, they are OpEx and cost and we will be putting in OpEx in 2020. But these initiatives, when you look them together are going to be accretive in 2021. It’s going to give us much higher asset and lane utilization. It’s going to give us better competitiveness and more pricing power.  It’s going to give us additional business and allow us to continue at our lower cost and we are just really excited about this opportunity. Now is the time, we seize the moment and we believe investors expect us to seize these kinds of opportunities and that’s what we are doing. Brian will talk a little bit more about the effect for 2020 and then of course, we have already said accretive in 2021.  So, yes, fast, faster and we are going to continue to be speeding up our network for our customers. Thanks for the question. 
David Abney: Yes, we will, Tom. This is David and I’ll let Kate to follow-up. What I can tell you is we are focused on serving the entire e-commerce ecosystem. And that includes large e-tailers, that includes the large retailers and that includes the SMBs, the thousands and thousands of SMBs that we have to compete and to punch above their weight with the larger companies.  Just a few things to point out, when it comes to the major retailers, over 90% of the larger retailers utilize our innovative services and we’ve seen their business grow. I’ll just give you a few examples of that target Qurate Retail Group, Macy's, GAP, Kohl's, Best Buy, Overstock. I mean, all of those companies have seen our innovative solutions and we have grown.  But where our real passion is in this area is, allowing and enabling small and mid-sized businesses to compete against the bigger companies and that’s where you saw just a straying of announcements yesterday. We made more product and service announcements in 2019 than we made in my entire career at UPS and we are following it this year.  And Kate, I’ll turn it over to you to highlight a few that you want to focus on. 
David Abney: Yes, there is just two that I want to highlight. One is, we’ve been a e-commerce shipper of choice for over years. This is something that we concentrated on six, seven years ago and we have put the network in place and we will continue. But just two things I think is worth drawing out is, we talk a lot about the structural change of Next Day Air and Next Day in general.  And our extended hours Next Day program where we can pickup – get late pickups and we can actually serve 98% of the population for our brick and mortar retailers that’s within a 150 miles of their locations. We can cover 98%. That is industry-leading and that is giving them a competitive advantage. It allows them to hit Next Day through their Ground network.  And then – so that was very important. The other one that we’ve made a lot of announcements about, but we are just speeding through and that’s Access Points and we are adding in the press release, another 1,500 Access Points, new package express centers. What makes this unique is this is in a lot of rural areas, people that don’t have a lot of options and by the time these get implemented with the others we have announced, 92% of the population of the U.S. will be within five miles of our Access Points.  So it just gives you some good examples of what we are doing to maintain our status as the e-commerce shipper of choice. Thank you. 
David Abney: Okay. This is David and I will – and our business did increased with them over 2019 and part of which was due to a structural change and this focus on Next Day. And we foresaw that change and we had the list available and we really took advantage of that, not only with the large e-tailers, but with other companies that are matching that same structural change. We also had competitive wins. We have large e-tailers and others.  And we saw a little bit of a muted growth top-line from International and Supply Chain due to macro conditions and of course, that made the percent revenue a little bit larger. But one of the things we want to focus on is, at the same time that we took on additional volume that we did bring our cost per piece down significantly in the U.S. operations for the fourth quarter, in fact, on an adjusted basis by more than 3% from the year before.  And also, that other customers are able to take advantage of some of this capacity and structure. So, other retailers and small and mid-sized companies have been able to take advantage in the same way. As long as there is with any of our big customers, as long as there is a mutually beneficial relationship, then we will continue and we will find ways to win together.  But we also find ways to continue to help our small and mid-sized companies and others to compete against those large opportunities, whether it’s through Ware2Go or e-fulfillment or Access Points or other options. So, that’s kind of a run down about where we stand. Thank you. 
David Abney: This is David. I’ll take the first part of that question and I’ll turn the CapEx over. So, from an OpEx standpoint, on speeding up the initiatives, this is really about how to increase the asset and lane utilization of our transportation network. It’s about competitiveness, it’s about pricing power. When you have a much faster network, you don’t have to discount as much.  We also don’t have to have customized solutions. So we are going to be able to take some of those that we have put over the years to help speed the network. We are going to be able to take that out. But we really see that we are going to get additional business and that was the thing that got our attention so much last year is when we put these first ones in, we way exceeded the return of additional packages than we were going to get.  So when you put this infrastructure in place, it’s not fully utilized at first. It takes a while to grow. But based on what we’ve seen last year and what we expect to see this year, the revenue and the pricing power from this move is going to more than take care of the operating cost. That’s why we are boldly saying that this is accretive and it’s accretive in 2021 and we’ve got the – so far the examples to show that.  So let’s turn over to the CapEx side and that's to you, Brian. 
David Abney: I’ll talk about phase one of the China deal and then Nando will go further than that. We think the U.S. China Phase one was a historic agreement, as much for what it kept from happening with additional tariffs being implemented, plus what was covered in the actual agreement and certainly looking forward to working with governments on both sides for Phase two. But a positive start there.  When you take a look at that, and you also take a look at the terminal dues change that is going into effect this year, which is going to allow us with our worldwide economy service to really compete in cross-global e-commerce cross border, I should have said, the e-commerce shipments that we haven’t been able to do before, because of the very low cost of the terminal dues.  So that’s gotten addressed and so, we do see some positive momentum and I’ll turn it over to you Nando to talk about the business units.
David Abney: So, a key point that Kate brought up on our Air volume really and we gained significant market share last year in our U.S. Air network. We’ve been gaining market share in that sector at least for the last five years, if not five of the five years. So we’ve been constantly investing in aircraft and have 11 more that we are putting in this year that benefit the International cascades to the Domestic.  So, this is something that we offer a clear differentiated value advantage to our customers and they are rewarding us and it’s going very well for us. 
David Abney: Good, Scott. Yes, I am sure, you could see on this call that we are making significant progress in executing our strategies. The U.S. was certainly an excellent example of that through the fourth quarter. We are leaning into SMBs. The great majority of the solutions that – innovative solutions that we’ve announced in 2019, 2020 is to assist these SMBs to do more effective and to be able to compete with the larger companies.  And our transformation initiatives, they are driving efficiency and they are allowing us to provide these new innovative solutions. So these things are interrelated that go together. And the last thing I wanted to hit about our call today is we are absolutely speeding up our network and expanding our weekend. We see a unique opportunity here in the market and we are going to take advantage of it.  We are going to make those investments from an OpEx standpoint. And we do feel strongly it will be accretive in 2021. And we absolutely are convinced it’s the right thing to do. So, we are going to continue to accelerate. Move at a faster pace for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders, and our people.  So, thank you for joining us today.
Brian Newman: I’ll take that, Scott. Thanks, Ben for the question. It’s Brian. Look, we are confident in the $1 to $1.20 incremental EPS given the investments we have made already returning. We are looking at margin expansion across all three segments in 2019 and it’s just building on the momentum.  So I think by choosing to invest, accelerate and expand the investments in SMB that David referenced, we see opportunity to capture accretive growth going into 2021 and beyond. 
Brian Newman: Thanks, Ken for the question. Look, we are looking at the SMB initiatives in total as I broke it out, it’s a $0.33 total investment with two objectives. We are trying to accelerate the time and transit. We are going to reach over 80% of our customers and then in addition, expand the weekend coverage.  So, rather than breakout the $0.33, we are looking at it in totality as a program. We see it accretive to 2021 and beyond. Maybe I’ll let Juan take a stab at sharing some of the details of the two programs. 
Brian Newman: Yes, it’s Brian. Thanks very much for the question. So it has less to do with the changing of the seasonality. It’s more about the phasing and cadence of the investments we announced. The $0.33 OpEx investment or EPS headwinds that we are putting in. The revenue lag to those startup costs. So, as you think about Q1 and launching the investments, revenue comes a bit later.  And that’s why we are muting EPS in addition in the Supply Chain and Freight business, given the macro backdrop that we are expecting some rebound in the middle to late part of the year. So, those are the two elements impacting the phasing of the guidance. 
Brian Newman: Thanks, David. And David, thanks for the question. So, with respect to CapEx, you are right. The investments we talk about this morning, Harrisburg et cetera, those are all embedded within our capital guidance and envelope. David talked about the OpEx investment. But in terms of where we are headed on CapEx, you saw we are guiding to about 6.7% in 2020.  That’s really coming from a lot of efficiency being driven as we saw in 2019, as well as 2020. We see a glide path eventually moving down towards our historic average of 7%. And ultimately, if you look at the ROIC, which is among the leading industry and really it’s a good investment for the company in terms of the returns.  So, hope that gives you a little insight on the CapEx side. 
Kate Gutmann: Yes, absolutely. And so, clearly, we are the e-commerce provider of choice and David just brought life to that and focus on the SMBs, the exciting part of our solutions is that we actually are leaning in both on B2B and B2C. The speeding of time and transit help both and fast means, through the weekend. UPS only has the commercial offering for our customers helping the SMB to actually speed through the weekend and also replenish inventory.  So very impactful. And you know, these customers have told us, it’s about pace, speed and ease. And the ease is helping them to connect whether they are already existing and that is with Digital Access, that’s exactly what that does it brings together the community of buyers with the SMB sellers and attach My Choice For Business on that.  It helps them to control not only their outbound, but their inbound and the more you can do that, you save staffing, you save cost and then that helps them to reinvest into their businesses. So we do see these investments as accelerating growth and we are excited that it is with the structural shift in the Air, also the speed on the Ground and very excited.
Kate Gutmann: Thanks so much. This is Kate. So first, we are proud to be the B2B market leader and also to say that we grew B2B for the fifth consecutive quarter. This quarter’s B2B growth was fueled by retailer returns, returns growing 6% with our unmatched portfolio. So you can actually have the flexibility of returns, whether it be label list, package list and also right available on your mobile application.  So very excited about the progress that we’ve seen in that space. And then B2B a critical component of that is our healthcare strategy as well as our SMB with a large majority of B2B tied to those. Also David mentioned the structural shift. Structural shift comes with the businesses speeding and that also impacts B2B.  So, everything you see us doing with speeding time and transit, through that we can follow that to continuing our success with B2B. Thank you. 
Kate Gutmann: Okay. Sure. So, I’ll start with the revenue per piece. First of all, we were excited to deliver the positive operating leverage and George will speak more about that aligning the cost per piece with revenue per piece. As we’ve noted, revenue per piece was affected by weight per piece and customer mix. As we leaned into this structural shift that’s going on in the market, and we will continue to do so.  With that, we are seeing speeding, whether it be in the Air services. You saw our Air growth very strong. Three consecutive quarters over 20% with this past quarter at 26% for Next Day and double-digit for deferred. A lot of which by the way is coming from a very broad customer base heavily SMB in that area.  And then, David mentioned that Ground inclusion that we have, which is our extended hours, Next Day Ground and the coverage that we gain, 98% of the population by activating brick and mortar. That will continue.  So, shorter zone, some less weight, but solutions that gain the whole portfolio Air and Ground from our customers which will help RPP. And then, we remain committed to growing our price as aligned to our value and our cost per piece. 
Kate Gutmann: Yes. Absolutely. I think, it's a good starting place to say that we are the Air market share leader and we saw this and anticipated this change, the structural change going on in the market and leaned into it with our solutions.  And as a result, you’ve seen the strong Air growth three consecutive quarters over 20%. We do expect to continue to see healthy Air growth alongside related to what Brian was saying the Ground comes hand-in-hand. So, we are seeing Next Day Air, Two Day Air resonating across our customer base whether it be from healthcare, SMB, e-tailers, large retailers.  We have expanded capacity, additional planes, all of that tying together to the strategy. And then we’ve talked about the unmatched UPS network and the ability to cover 150 miles of One Day Ground, really activating our retailers and our SMBs brick and mortar to help them to better compete in the market. So flexing where their inventory is and then using whichever of our product fits for that need. So, healthy feature as well. 
Juan Perez: Yes, thanks, Brian. And as we think about the expansion of weekend delivery services, we started that already in the Q4. The advantage that we have is that we have a well defined integrated network that gives us unprecedented capabilities to be able to enable these services. We are going to leverage the relationship that we have with the USPS.  David made that reference to the Access Point network that we have. It’s a network that’s in place. We’ve already built that technology that supports the integration between UPS and the Access Points. That will make it really easy for us to be able to expand us well in those areas. And again, we will continue to provide services through the network that we’ve already built with the great people that we have supporting those operations. 
Juan Perez: Yes, Allison, this is Juan Perez. Thank you for the question. Just a couple of points, let me first clarify the $1.4 billion that we announced is for not just one facility in Pennsylvania. It’s a total of four facilities in Pennsylvania. The largest of those is the super hub we will be building in Harrisburg Pennsylvania. By the way, you have heard us talk about the Smart Logistics Network a number of times.  Part of the Smart Logistics Network is building critical capacity to support the needs of our e-commerce customers. We continue to build that capacity. We’ve been very effective. That capacity is yielding the expected results.  Your question next talks about how we continue to improve the facilities that we build. We have this philosophy at UPS that every time we build a new facility, that facility is going to have the next-generation of advanced technologies that will help us continue to build capabilities, improve our automation, reduce our hours.  In this particular building, we expect to see some really unique technologies. More data analytics that will provide better insights on how the facility is running. Of course, how it can help the overall network and we also expect these new facilities to use the latest and greatest automation technologies that we have.  The CapEx is included in our three year plan. So this is something that we have been planning all along as we continue to build our Smart Logistics Network. We are excited about what we are building in the Northeast critical corridor for UPS. 
Juan Perez: Just a couple of quick statements folks. The first one that I think, it’s important for you guys to know is that at the end of 2019, 75% of our U.S. eligible Ground volume was actually sorted through automation.  In addition to that, we had completed the rollout of UPS ORION Navigation. That gave us significant benefits, especially as we bring seasonal workers on and they needed that type of technology to improve their overall delivery capabilities.  And of course, we don’t know that we are introducing additional technologies on the dispatch on delivery side that are going to continue to help us throughout peak season. The benefit of automated facilities cannot be understated. We actually exceeded throughout the year and certainly throughout peak season, we expect that production improvements that we get from automation.  We introduced new solutions as well in terms of autonomous-guided vehicles in our automated facilities to support the movement of bulk. All those solutions proves extremely valuable in executing our successful peak season and we are already planning for 2020. That’s the way that we now approach peak season for a number of years.
