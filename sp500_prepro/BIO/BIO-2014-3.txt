Christine A. Tsingos: So, for the $0.73 what we used were the FCPA matter, and that was it. So, I always I’m hesitant to do this, Brandon, because we report on a GAAP basis, but there were kind of three big one-time items in the quarter. There was cost of $3.1 million in cost of goods sold for some manufacturing shutdown. There was the incremental $12 million for the FCPA accrual. And then we also had a benefit of about $3.5 million in the purchase evaluation as the earn out for GnuBIO. The $0.73 estimate is really just excluding the $12 million for FCPA, the $3.1 million cost of manufacturing shutdown is kind of offset by the $3.5 million upside and you know what we don’t like to go down that pro forma route. So…S. Brandon Couillard – Jefferies LLC: That’s helpful.
Christine A. Tsingos: I think from life science on a year-to-date basis China is still fairly, fairly flat. The pipeline going into Q4 seems pretty good for life science in China, a lot of that demand around the digital PCR is global demand that we’re seeing. The other thing in the quarter we had a good process media quarter and that’s kind of a lumpy business. So some of the growth was driven by ordering in the process media side.S. Brandon Couillard – Jefferies LLC: Super, I will hop back in the queue. Thank you.
Christine A. Tsingos: I think that on a currency neutral basis, we’ve guided to 2.5% for the full year and I think we reiterate that guidance. In the fourth quarter, it’s clear that exchange rates are very different today. So on a reported basis, the growth rate could be much lower. And if we just kind of look at forecasted sales for the fourth quarter and we measure those using currency neutral rates versus currency rate. The difference is it’s more than $20 million. So that on a reported basis could affect the growth rate for the year.
Christine A. Tsingos: Okay, great. Thank you, Ryan. Well, thank you everyone for taking the time to join us today. Bye-bye.
