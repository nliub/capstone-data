Christine A. Tsingos: Dan, that's a really great question. And you may remember on the third quarter call, we were kind of estimating that disruption could have been $5 million to $10 million range and it's really hard to pinpoint that number. But I think we made up at least 90% of whatever that number was, pick something in the middle, $7 million, $8 million. I think that was part of the growth in Q4, but it's difficult to pinpoint exactly how much is make up from Q3 and how much is Q4. Without a doubt, we knew going into Q4 where the orders were coming in and the demand wave that was in front of us. So I don't want to take away from the organic nature of the fourth quarter either.
Christine A. Tsingos: And I think in terms of the outlook in the plan, Dan, we don't have the clearance yet, I think we remain very optimistic that we will receive it. But at the time as we've said all along coming into the North American market with the gel technology while quite compelling for the customers. It is a long sales cycle and not something that happens overnight. So I think we've been very conservative in our expectations all along as to how quickly we would ramp up and take share in the U.S. market, and I think that's true for the 2016 plan as well.
Christine A. Tsingos: Yeah. I think the operating margin was closer to 11% for the quarter instead of the 10.5% on a currency neutral basis.
Christine A. Tsingos: Yeah. So I think Shannon's probably a better person to speak about the opportunity and how it fits in our product family.
Christine A. Tsingos: Okay, well thank you everyone for taking the time to join us today. We appreciate your interest and of course, we are available for any follow-up questions that you may have. Bye-bye.
