A - Tony Huegel: In the spirit of one question, I’ll go ahead and answer your first one and then we’ll pick the second one up hopefully from someone else or I’ll ask you to get back in the queue, okay.
A - Tony Huegel: Okay. As you think about new inventory and I would say similar situation to what we talked about in the past, in the sense that we continue to have new inventory well below the competitors. We tend to have 50% or less as you look at inventory as a percent of sales and that continues to be the case. We continue to evaluate that of course as we go through the year and see various changes in the market. Used equipment continues to be a challenge. We are making good progress on used equipment. As you look at some of the factors from a large Ag perspective, we’re down about 10% year-over-year in July in terms of where we’re at with used inventory. Pricing is holding in okay, if you look at it kind of from a two-year average, we would be slightly below that. But believe we continue to maintain a healthy premium versus our competition. And again, we are making progress but it’s likely we would expect these efforts will continue into 2016, we continue to coordinate with our dealers to assist with the movement of the used equipment. But it is still especially on large tractors continues to be a challenge that we’re working on within the market.
A - Tony Huegel: One of the challenges that we do have in terms of comparison year-over-year is there are some timing differences in terms of when we have various phases of the early order programs. And the closing of the first phase is a bit different year-over-year. Now, having said that, so, I just want to make sure I have that clearly out front but directionally what we’re seeing is order activity on those early order programs are off year-over-year. And just to be clear, what we’re talking about is planters sprayers and tillage. A lot of people will have questions around combine early order programs I’m guessing, but remember those just started up in early August. And candidly it’s just too early to make any type of conclusions related to where that program is. One of the challenges we do have also as you think about the spring seasonal early order programs, and where we would think that perhaps in this current environment where they may not be as close of a correlation to overall, or as good of an indicator of overall demand going into next year, is the fact that they do have a much higher level of stock component versus retail orders in those spring seasonal order programs. And again, given the dynamics in the market, there is candidly not as much pressure to put orders in at this particular point. And we really believe the combine early order program, as that continues to develop, will be a better indicator of actual demand. And again, I want to be clear, I’m not trying to skirt the issue, certainly we are seeing in those early order programs, orders being off year-over-year which historically would indicate some additional weakening as you move into 2016.
A - Tony Huegel: Similar to last year we aren’t going to discuss the magnitude again, because and some of that goes back to the timing of the ending of the early order program. And it could give some misleading numbers both, more positive or more negative depending on the program in terms of when they actually close. So, but again, it is directionally down year-over-year. So we will go to the next.
A - Tony Huegel: Sure. I think some of that, as you look at the general economy, we’re starting to see that. As you look, there are different confidence indicators that are available as well, and those are starting to trend more positive still – I want to be clear, I mean, they’re still in more negative territory but directionally moving the right direction in the sense of a more positive direction in terms of overall sentiment. And we are, and as you look at the forecast change, obviously for Ag & Turf we did bring the sales forecast down slightly but there was, there were couple markets that were a little weaker but some offsetting strength in Europe. So we’re seeing a little bit of improvement but as Susan pointed out, we’re seeing early indications of the possibility that you’re going to start to see some turnaround there.
A - Tony Huegel: Remember, as you think about Construction & Forestry, and we talked about this earlier in the year because there was some question as to why ending receivables and inventory were up as much as they were versus the forecasted sales increase. And as you recall, there were some changes in 2015 related to wholesale terms which we believe was going to drive some higher level of receivables and that has been the case. So, that’s part of what’s driving that. Now, as you look at the underlying forecast for receivables and inventory, it looks like there was just a slight reduction. Actually, what’s underlying there is more of a reduction in receivables, so field inventory with some offsetting increase in inventory so Deere company-owned inventories. And again, some of that have to do with final Tier 4 transitions, and plans along that way, as well as recognizing this has been a pretty rapid change in the business environment. There was about seven-point change in our sales outlook. I’m sorry, apparently I said a decrease in receivables, there is an increase in receivables, no, no, a decrease in the forecasted receivables, in the level of forecast. So, again, we’re still - just to be clear, we’re still forecasting an increase in receivables but it’s less of an increase versus our prior guidance. And inventory is a little higher than in our prior guidance. And again, a combination of final Tier 4 and as well as just the rapid change in that business environment from an inventory perspective.
A - Tony Huegel: We would always be evaluating as we move forward, and this would be true not just for C&F, this would be true for Ag & Turf as well. We are always evaluating business environment and what we feel we need from an inventory or receivables. So, whether it’s a company owned inventory or a field inventory level. And what I can tell you is we will make those changes as quickly as we can. And I think fourth quarter last year is a good example of our ability to make those changes very rapidly, if we see the environment changing and necessitating that, so.
A - Tony Huegel: Sure. Certainly if you look at our guidance for the year, last quarter we were at 2 points for fiscal year ‘15 and our current guidance is one point. I’ll start with recognizing that both last quarter and this quarter there is some fair amount of rounding to get to that whole number. So we’ve been fluctuating candidly right around 1.5 points. And we just happen, the last quarter it rounded up and this quarter rounds down. Now, so there hasn’t been a substantial change in the pricing environment since last quarter. And I would say it’s a little bit of both. Certainly I wouldn’t point all to Ag & Turf I mean Construction & Forestry continues to be a challenging environment. We have competitors in the marketplace who are very aggressive on pricing right now. And that hasn’t changed. And if anything has potentially gotten a bit stronger over the year. And so, it is a little bit of a decrease in terms of price realization really coming from both. Okay, and with that we’ll go to next caller.
A - Tony Huegel: Couple of things there. First of all, keep in mind as you think about cash receipts and I think we would agree on this as well, it’s not necessarily one-for-one in the sense of 2016 cash receipts driving 2016 sales. Remember it’s a combination of both current year and prior year. So, as you look at while it’s relatively flat from ‘15 to ‘16, when you look at the 2014/2015 combination that drove last year’s sales, and the 2015/2016 cash receipts looking in into next year, you’d have to argue that it would be down even more than what just the single year-over-year implications would be. What I would tell you is, at this point given that outlook in cash receipts, given what we’re seeing and in the very early stages of our early order programs it is likely that you would see some reduction, further reduction in large Ag sales retail sales next year.
A - Tony Huegel: Keep in mind, and again, I hate using this explanation. But do remember that our operating profit outlook forecast for both Ag & Turf and C&F are rounded numbers. And so, it can drive some differences as you come down to operating profit. I wouldn’t cite anything on any of those factors that you just pointed out that would be a significant change for the year. Obviously on the tax rate, we are as normal. We continue to assume no discreet items and tax rate being in that 34% to 36% range. We’ve had some positive discreet items through the year that have pulled the year-to-date rate down. But we’d use that 34% to 36% for the forward-looking period but outside of that nothing really noteworthy that I could point to.
A - Tony Huegel: I would - certainly I would say that I would be a little careful to extrapolate what happens in the U.S. drives global markets. So you would really have to look at that statement would be true if you look at production on a global basis being positive than on a global basis there would be certainly some challenges to see some increases. And as you look, you see some varying weather patterns but not of any kind of significant factor in that regard. Again, as we look into next year, well we don’t have of course any guidance until next quarter, we are starting to see some positive signs coming from Europe in that regard that certainly as you look at other parts of the world, we’ll see what happens with the growing conditions in Brazil as we move forward. They’re heading towards planting season now and we’ll see what factors might be driven there. Keep in mind as we go into 2016, we did have some favorable weather conditions, El Nino actually strengthened through the summer. And that certainly bodes well normally for U.S. market or growing areas. But keep in mind that can have some more negative and dry impact on other parts of the world. So, as you think about weather, there are a number of regions of the world that we would point to on a watch-list if you will of what impact El Nino may have, when you think about Southeast Asia, India, Australia, even Brazil and Argentina, quite often that can drive some very wet spring summer type of weather, which a little bit of extra moisture is good in some cases, but if it’s excessive obviously that can have some negative ramifications as well. So, we’ll see how things develop as we move forward for the rest of the world. But certainly we did have a very good summer here in the U.S. from a weather perspective at least in aggregate. And you’re seeing that reflected in the guidance or the outlook for yields.
A - Tony Huegel: As you think about fourth quarter and decrementals, implied within the forecast if you look at sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter you would see some higher decrementals. So it would be around 32% for equipment ops is roughly, what’s implied there. But keep in mind you also have a fourth quarter where we’re forecasting the largest reduction in terms of year-over-year sales on a percentage basis at that 24% reduction. And so, the next closest quarter would have been first quarter where our decrementals were 35%. So, again I would argue sequentially would be a little higher decremental but still very good performance and especially relative to what we in the first quarter, would be very very strong. There was a hint at the UAW contract we’ll begin negotiations later this month to officially kick those off. Beyond that as agreed on with UAW we really just have no comments related to that. And we’ll have to leave that there. So, we’ll move on to the next caller.
A - Tony Huegel: If you do a full 10% and if that 10% was exactly 10.0%, I would agree with you. But as I said before, remember, when we say 10% that’s anywhere from 9.5% to 10.4% round to…
A - Tony Huegel: We will have to take it offline, but remember again as I said, this is both the margins are rounded. And so, again, just like we had with pricing there are times when you’re rounding it can be more aggressive than other times. So you have to take that into consideration as you’re trying to reconcile down to where we are with our net income number. And so, beyond that there is really not much more I can say. When we follow-up later, we can certainly discuss this a bit more.
A - Tony Huegel: Yes, our forecast would not be negative in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind as you think about that as I mentioned earlier, remember there is rounding in that number. So, even within some of the other prior quarters, third quarter for example, we were actually running much closely to that 1.5 points versus, even in our prior forecast when you saw the 2 points we were rounding up to that 2 points. Now we’re rounding down to 1 point. And so, the implied change from last quarter to this quarter isn’t a full point.
A - Tony Huegel: And just to clarify, both divisions while we don’t talk about details by division, both divisions are forecasting positive price in the fourth quarter.
A - Tony Huegel: We can take that offline too and talk about a little bit more detail, but yes, actually again, I think as you look for the year, we’re certainly continuing to forecast we think very strong cash flow, down a little bit as receivables and inventory adjusted in the quarter versus prior guidance, is that adjusted in the quarter but still very healthy level of cash flow. Okay, next caller.
A - Tony Huegel: Yes, I think normally we would be, some of that can be mix driven to your point. And I think as you think about that decremental, especially in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, keeping in mind some of that is caused by the rapid change in the environment. So, as you think about pulling some of the levers we would pull, those sorts of things, there are lead times on that. So, if we would continue to see negative sales going into 2016, certainly that division would be looking at ways to improve the decremental sounds like an odd way to say it, but to see lower levels of decrementals.
A - Tony Huegel: Well, first of all, I would keep one thing to keep in mind is as you’re looking at year-to-date data out of Brazil, that’s a calendar basis. And we would be looking at a fiscal basis, so we still have within our outlook for fiscal 2015 we still have November/December of last year where those FINAME rates were still at very low levels relative to where they are today. And so I think that maybe some of the change in terms of what our outlook is versus maybe what you’re seeing in the calendar year-to-date numbers.
A - Tony Huegel: Yes, I think it’s FINAME financing I would argue has created some stabilization with the announcement earlier this year of rates really through next June of 2016. The funding seems to be appropriate, so they didn’t increase it from where rates went to in April of this year. And so, there is some stability there of course, there is always risk that that can change. And again, the funding that was announced is, we believe at a very appropriate level for the business, so that’s one positive aspect. But I think FX creates certainly uncertainty in the environment, farmers there have benefited from the weakening of the real in this year as they sell their crops in U.S. dollars and they convert that back. It’s actually kept their cash receipts and margins pretty favorable. But there is always the risk of when does that change and move back the other direction. So, there is uncertainty there. And more importantly just around the general economy and that doesn’t seem to be seeing much stabilization at this point. I’d argue that’s probably the biggest risk as we move next year.
A - Tony Huegel: Yes, at this point we really haven’t talked about any kind of renewal rate publicly and that sort of thing but clearly as we’ve talked about longer term from intelligence in machinery that’s a key focus that we continue to have especially around machine and job optimization functions. From an R&D perspective I think we’ve talked about as well, certainly increasing the amount that we’re spending in that area today. What we spend on intelligence would be comparable to the type of R&D we would have on things like large tractors or combines. So it’s certainly right up in parity. With that and again just reflects the importance that we see of intelligence as we move forward. And we think we have a great opportunity to continue to provide efficiency to our customers through intelligence and believe that will be a way that we continue to differentiate as we move forward.
A - Tony Huegel: Yes, that’s just not something we’ve commented on publicly. So we’re going to have to move on to the final call. We have time for one more call. Thank you.
A - Tony Huegel: Right. First of all I want to be clear we did not have guidance on 2016. I think a lot of people implied some of our commentary to assume we were looking at flat for 2016. We were using that as an example, just like Raj earlier mentioned if it were down 10% what would our decremental margins be, I want to be clear we are not trying to signal down 10% for next year on all product lines, that’s just an example. And we similarly use that really to reflect the fact that as we under-produce this year, you don’t need an increase in end-markets, retail sales to necessarily see an increase in Deere sales. But clearly as you look at the early order programs, I want to be clear there as well. We’re down year-over-year we’re not talking about seeing the type of magnitude of decrease that we saw last year but certainly down directionally is what we’re seeing in those early order programs at this point. So, in that regard we certainly have under-produced this year from a new inventory perspective. Certainly we feel like, our inventories will be in good shape. But as I mentioned earlier in the call, we will have some additional challenges to work through next year on used equipment especially as it relates to large tractors. Beyond that there is not much more I can really say about 2016.
A - Tony Huegel: In the spirit of one question, I’ll go ahead and answer your first one and then we’ll pick the second one up hopefully from someone else or I’ll ask you to get back in the queue, okay.
A - Tony Huegel: Okay. As you think about new inventory and I would say similar situation to what we talked about in the past, in the sense that we continue to have new inventory well below the competitors.

Pricing is holding in okay, if you look at it kind of from a two-year average, we would be slightly below that. But believe we continue to maintain a healthy premium versus our competition. And again, we are making progress but it’s likely we would expect these efforts will continue into 2016, we continue to coordinate with our dealers to assist with the movement of the used equipment. But it is still especially on large tractors continues to be a challenge that we’re working on within the market.

From an R&D perspective I think we’ve talked about as well, certainly increasing the amount that we’re spending in that area today. What we spend on intelligence would be comparable to the type of R&D we would have on things like large tractors or combines. So it’s certainly right up in parity. With that and again just reflects the importance that we see of intelligence as we move forward. And we think we have a great opportunity to continue to provide efficiency to our customers through intelligence and believe that will be a way that we continue to differentiate as we move forward.
A - Tony Huegel: Yes, that’s just not something we’ve commented on publicly. So we’re going to have to move on to the final call. We have time for one more call. Thank you.
A - Tony Huegel: Right. First of all I want to be clear we did not have guidance on 2016. I think a lot of people implied some of our commentary to assume we were looking at flat for 2016. We were using that as an example, just like Raj earlier mentioned if it were down 10% what would our decremental margins be, I want to be clear we are not trying to signal down 10% for next year on all product lines, that’s just an example. And we similarly use that really to reflect the fact that as we under-produce this year, you don’t need an increase in end-markets, retail sales to necessarily see an increase in Deere sales. But clearly as you look at the early order programs, I want to be clear there as well. We’re down year-over-year we’re not talking about seeing the type of magnitude of decrease that we saw last year but certainly down directionally is what we’re seeing in those early order programs at this point. So, in that regard we certainly have under-produced this year from a new inventory perspective. Certainly we feel like, our inventories will be in good shape. But as I mentioned earlier in the call, we will have some additional challenges to work through next year on used equipment especially as it relates to large tractors. Beyond that there is not much more I can really say about 2016.
A - Raj Kalathur: Hi Mike, this is Raj. Let me add that broader picture, the weather has been good so far and production for grains on a global basis are likely to be good. Now, the other side of the equation, demand has grown as well, and that’s always been what we are saying, if you take since the mid-90s the demand for grains have grown consistently and it’s grown very nicely this year as well. So, the demand-supply equilibrium is still pretty tight. You again see like June/July type conditions where, if there is excess rain or assumptions of any shortfall in weather conditions and the prices just vary quickly. So, again, the demand side is also very healthy.
A - Raj Kalathur: Okay Mig, this is Raj. Let me take that. Now, you’re asking kind of hypothetical question. For 2016, now don’t take this answer as indicating any forecast for 2016, right. So the answer depends on the mix of products, the level of softness we’re going to see or level of upside we might see in 2016 and several other factors. Now, if we assume all of the factors stay the same and say demand for all product lines are down by 10% from the 2015 forecasted levels, we should be able to deliver less than 40% decremental margins like we did this year. And remember, our units prepare not only for the forecasted scenario but also for downside and upside scenarios. And we expect to manage assets and costs with discipline as always to deliver at least 12% operating, return on operating assets at about 80% of mid-cycle. And at the enterprise level, we have plans in place for 2016 SA&G, R&D and on the cash side capital expenditures. And if we are able to execute with discipline to our plans as we normally have, we should deliver decent decremental or incremental margins depending on the scenario we face.
A - Raj Kalathur: So, I’m not sure why you’re saying it’s weaker. The previous forecast for cash flow from operations was $3.4 billion, the current is about $3.2 billion, but $100 million should be explained by our net income in our guidance reduction from $1.9 billion to $1.8 billion, and the rest of that is essentially working capital. By the way the $3.2 billion, as we actually achieve would be I think the third best in recent history if not the third best ever.
A - Raj Kalathur: I think we look at operating cash flow, if you look at - if you reduce the capital, the capital expenditures are actually, our forecast for capital expenditures, last quarter to this quarter has actually come down. So, I still am not adding up what you’re adding up yet, so.

A - Raj Kalathur: I think from our perspective, our dealers tend to react pretty quickly when they see some of those changes in terms of their end demand. We are hearing, and again, as Susan pointed out in her comments, when you think about C&F, there is little bit of dichotomy because you talk to our contractors, our dealers, the sentiment is generally - fairly positive especially outside of those energy impacted areas. The underlying fundamentals that we would normally point to are actually fairly positive year-over-year. We’re just seeing a softness in orders. And certainly in energy is weaker year-over-year. You’re hearing some, there is commentary about some of the independent rental companies for example shifting inventory out of those areas that are more energy dependent into the rest of the country. And that is in fairly large sizes, some large auctions and in places like Western Canada, in more recent months, so those sorts of things can have some impact. So, again, we’ll see as we move forward where this market ends up going. But both in current year as well as you look out into 2016, most of the indications from a general economic perspective would be relatively positive. But again, as I started to say, our dealers respond quickly with our order fulfillment process and the ability for them to replenish equipment very rapidly. They tend to when there is uncertainty, they tend to pull-back quickly and adjust their inventories very rapidly which is exactly what we would hope to see. And that’s really what we’ve seen in the quarter as well as is those dealers making those adjustments quickly. And with that, we’ll go ahead with the next caller.

Q - David Raso: Thank you. I apologize in advance for making this a math question, but guys, I’m sorry I need to understand this because obviously the fourth quarter is going to influence how people think about ‘16. I know you mentioned rounding Tony but I heard you correctly, C&F margins for the full year 10%, Ag & Turf 8%, that’s just a clarification, correct me if I’m wrong.
Q - David Raso: I appreciate it. And again, I apologize for the math. I just wanted to clarify. So thank you. We’ll talk later.
