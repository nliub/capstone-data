Darius Adamczyk: Thank you, Greg. Letâs turn to slide 8 and talk of the more aspirational approach we are taking toward ESG commitments. At Honeywell, our commitment to improving the world beyond our product portfolio begins with our four pillars of corporate social responsibility: inclusion & diversity; employees in action; STEM education; and sustainability. Weâre embedding inclusion and diversity into all our systems and processes at Honeywell from our enterprise-wide hiring protocols to our supplier diversity program. Our 9,000 employees belong to 1 of the 8 diverse employee networks and the number is growing every day, allowing us to provide opportunities for the education and allyship to all employees. We believe this approach is not only the right thing to do, but also a fundamental enabler of improved business results. Honeywell has set the guide rails for our culture of inclusion and diversity and our employees consistently go beyond what is expected and improve that culture. When Honeywell set up the Ukraine Relief Fund to provide underground aid and employee support, the generosity of our employees helped us raise over $1 million. Our employees are active outside work in their local community as well, volunteering over 4,000 hours in 2021. Honeywell is also committed to improving our local communities through STEM education to shape the great minds of tomorrow. Weâre focusing on providing unserved students access to education thatâll provide -- that will drive innovation. Some of our initiatives include education and skill development programs in high-growth regions, college scholarships for students and STEM pathways and refurbished laptop distribution programs. Another way Honeywell improves local communities is through sustainability organizations that protect our environment and create a greener world through our partnership with the Swades Foundation and America Cares (sic)  India Foundation that have helped provide over 10,000 Indian homes with access to drinking water and solar electricity. These pillars allow Honeywell to use its resources to create a long-lasting positive impact in the lives of our employees and the communities they live in around the world. Now letâs turn to Slide 9 for some closing thoughts before we move into Q&A. We continue to execute on our value creation framework, effectively managing through ongoing external difficulties and over delivering on our financial commitments. We remain optimistic about our future, including our ability to deliver differentiated results through the cycle. We raised the midpoint of our full year organic sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance as well as increased our segment margin rate, fully absorbing higher than previously anticipated foreign exchange impact. Iâm proud of everyone at Honeywell is working hard to adapt and deliver in this challenging environment. While there is a heightened level of macro uncertainty at present, we continue to be confident in our ability to execute on the factors within our control. With that, Sean, letâs move to Q&A.
Darius Adamczyk: Yes. Well, yes, as you saw, the business was still down in Q2. But if you look at -- if you combine the long cycle and the long-cycle bookings for the first half, itâs actually been up year-over-year, so things are looking better. Obviously, as we look at the Ukraine situation and the focus of a lot of our NATO allies, we do anticipate some positive tailwinds in the next 6 to 12 months. So similar to what some of the other peer companies, particularly in the defense reported, we do expect that to be a tailwind as we head into 2023 and beyond. Well, obviously, itâs been a headwind so far for us this year.
Darius Adamczyk: Yes. Well, UOP was -- if you think about one business that got hit disproportionately hard by Russia, it was UOP. I mean it was a substantial headwind. I think it was 6...
Darius Adamczyk: Yes. So thatâs --that absorbed most of the Russia hit, and actually, we had some very robust bookings for Russia, which were canceled for UOP.
Darius Adamczyk: Yes. So Julian, just kind of in summary, itâs probably 3 primary things. Number one is PMT mix, particularly in UOP, which is favorable, and we know it pretty well because itâs a long-cycle business. Number two is some leverage and some cost actions, particularly in SPS, which will provide us margin favorability and a bit more volume leverage also in Q4. Because as you kind of look through the year, the equation will shift from more sort of price gains, the more volume leverages we get to Q4. So thatâs why Q4 looks a bit more -- a bit higher in terms of margin profile. Itâs -- this is very much in line with our original model. So thereâs nothing really dramatically different than what we expected.
Darius Adamczyk: And due to primarily very robust OE demand, which obviously is -- from a mix perspective, is negative. But really nothing there thatâs different than our expectations.
Darius Adamczyk: Yes, sure. Absolutely. Let me help unpack that. Certainly, weâre trying to stay ahead of inflation. Thatâs been a playbook. Weâre trying to get price where we can. And we have pretty good metrics and visibility in exactly where inflation is, how itâs broken down by business unit, how weâre seeing it. And now weâve embedded that into our operating system that -- such that we can identify it, act. And we do that in multiple ways. I mean, obviously, price is one lever, managing the mix to things that we can sell that are higher margin profile. Weâve done some redesigns which are also net helpful also generate some cost benefit. The thing Iâm particularly pleased about is I can tell you, well, full transparency, 9 months ago, that was not part of our playbook. I think we stumbled a little bit 9 months ago, and Iâm really thrilled because now itâs part of our operating system. We know what to do. Itâs underpinned by the fact we have great data visibility, great analytics, 1 source of truth, which really enables us to take much more precise management actions to manage the headwinds we see in inflation.
Darius Adamczyk: Yes. I mean, I think some of the Warehouse kind of overcapacity in the market has been pretty well publicized, so Iâm not going to dwell on that. I mean, obviously, weâre seeing that too. And frankly, we forget that the PET business grew at 50% in 2021 and at a similar rate in 2020. So I think that, frankly, what it needs to happen is that some of this capacity needs to be absorbed. Weâre very, very excited about the future of warehouse automation. So this is a bit of a blip for the next few quarters. And midterm, we think that this is going to be still a very good business. And youâre right, from a mix perspective, although there is obviously -- to the top line, there is an impact; from a mix -- margin mix perspective, this would be net helpful because our LSS business is growing. Some of our projects that we are securing are at higher margin rates. So net-net, this is not something weâre particularly that worried about. I mean, we wish the business was there from a top line perspective. But overall, I think this is a storm that weâre definitely going to weather, and we still love the segment that weâre in, in warehouse automation.
Darius Adamczyk: Yes. Well, I mean, I think let me just kind of talk a little bit about the COO role and Vimal, specifically. I mean as you can imagine, we do -- a lot of the operational outputs that we get donât happen by accident. It takes a lot of hard work and attention to detail and pursuing data and so on. And I kind of found myself maybe more in the middle of that than maybe I wanted to be. Maybe thatâs good and bad. And frankly, some of these other aspects and M&A and BD is certainly one of those is an area that I probably should be spending a little bit more time in. But I would add to that, customer outreach and people development strategy and some of the other brand building, things that, frankly, I should be doing. And I -- to be very transparent, Iâve talked about that openly to my own staff multiple times. And I think that the best way to kind of solve that is to really partner with Vimal to be the COO. I mean, heâs got a great track record at Honeywell. Heâs been extraordinarily successful in running HBT. Heâs run HPS. Heâs run PMT. Itâs got 33 yearsâ worth of experience. There arenât too many mysteries to Vimal that he doesnât know at Honeywell with that kind of multi-business experience and multicontinent experience, because heâs lived in Asia, Europe and North America. So heâs going to be a great partner for us to do things. And I think this is going to be a net positive for Honeywell, because it will allow me to do some other things that are going to be very beneficial. And yes, BD and M&A is going to be one of those things.
Darius Adamczyk: Yes. No, we love our Advanced Materials business. I mean, youâre seeing a lot of things. Youâve seen the strength of our Solstice business really picking up. We kind of forget that we have an electronic materials business, probably the only electronic materials and chemicals business based in the U.S. So you can imagine what kind of future that has. And the business is very robust. Weâve invested in capacity expansion. Those capacity expansions are not even yet shown in our results and will really come to fruition in 2023. So not only are we excited about how the business is performing in â22. Things could get even better for â23. So weâre very thrilled with the performance of Advanced Materials.
Darius Adamczyk: Yes. Yes. So let me kind of unpack, because thereâs really 2 questions. Let me very quickly open the PMT question. So no, we donât envision Vimal holding on to both roles. But what we wanted to do is to make sure that it became clear that the PMT role is open. Because as always, when we have big roles like that open, we want to consider internal and external candidates. And frankly, itâs much tougher to recruit when a role isnât vacated, so heâs going to serve in both roles. As you can imagine, early on, and heâs got to pay a lot of attention to PMT. But as we fill that role, heâs going to take over more of the COO role. So thatâs the first part. Yes, weâve seen some of the same outputs on the consumer. And youâre right, we donât have a lot of consumer exposure. I mean most of that consumer exposure went away with the 2 spins. So thatâs spot on as well. We see it a little bit indirectly. I talked about it in the Intelligrated play, because sort of -- there was some level of assumption that sort of this consumer demand would keep on going. Itâs kind of slowed down and consumers have a little bit of a different behavior, so we see it there. But I would just say this. If you go back to 2020 right after the pandemic hit us, we probably had one of the most unfavorable pandemic portfolio you could have out there, right? I mean our 2 biggest businesses were aerospace and energy. And frankly, other than maybe hospitality, those got hit about as hard as anything else. Well, I think weâre kind of entering a little bit of a different cycle, and I actually think that no matter what you count in terms of the recession period, I donât see a substantial reduction in OE build rates for aerospace, air travel. Thereâs a lot of pent-up demand, and you see it. You see it more on the consumer side. And my bet is youâre going to see it more and more on the business side. Thereâs still a lot of pent-up demand to travel. And letâs be honest, a widebody, at least in international travel, is nowhere near where it was in 2019. So I think weâre entering a cycle here, which is actually going to have a very favorable market mix, market conditions. Obviously, thatâs underpinned by the kind of backlog position we have. So weâre cautiously optimistic that even in a recessionary environment, which may happen, I think weâre still going to do quite well.
Darius Adamczyk: Overall, I mean, your theory is right that as some of these commodities come down, we may have an opportunity as we get into â23 for some margin expansion. It obviously varies by commodity. Some of them are indexed, some of them are not. So -- but directionally, I think your assertion is correct.
Darius Adamczyk: I think itâs a little bit of both. I mean, certainly, the business is growing. I think -- what Iâm particularly excited about is that HPT has the kind of solutions that our customers are seeking, both in terms of energy conservation, in terms of healthy buildings, healthy environments, clean air, visibility to their energy usage, visibility to their carbon emissions, all of these are -- these are solutions that we currently have in our portfolio, and there isnât a customer out there thatâs not interested. And thatâs reflected in their booking rates. I mean their booking rates were pretty much double digits, almost across the board for every one of their businesses. So itâs the right portfolio, right solutions and the business is doing very, very well.
Darius Adamczyk: No, not yet. I mean, frankly, our business in Germany, which is obviously the biggest economy, was actually up significantly in Q2, so weâre not kind of seeing any signs yet of any kind of a pickup. Weâre watching this as much as everybody else. We are as concerned as everybody else around sort of the energy profile as Europe heads into the winter. But so far, so good in terms of what we saw here in Q2.
Darius Adamczyk: Yes. So we are certainly not pulling anything from â23. So letâs just be very clear about that. There is no pull-ins. We donât need to do pull-ins because the business is robust. What weâre excited about is the LNG cycle. I mean, you see that investment taking place. You see it in the Middle East. You see it in the U.S. We are participating in it. UOP is participating. We had some very robust bookings that you saw in Q2 here. We actually expect more robust bookings in the second half of the year, and weâre very much part of that LNG cycle. Another really important data point, which is -- I donât know if this is well publicized, but we are also the leading player in renewable fuels or green fuels. And the solutions there just this year, our expectation is that the bookings in that segment would be up 3x versus what they were in 2021. So we are very excited. Itâs -- weâre kind of playing on the both ends of the barbell when it comes to the energy infrastructure. And I think this is exactly where you want to be. The world needs energy right now, and itâs most likely going to come from natural gas, and thereâs got to be a build-out. Thereâs going to be infrastructure build-out. Thereâs going to be E&P that takes place to supply the world with natural gas. You see that particularly pronounced in Europe. Weâre playing in that. Weâre also playing on sustainability and renewables and renewable fuels. And I just gave you the very specific data point on green, sustainable fuels, where weâre really a leader in that space. Weâre having more and more wins in plastics recycling. We have a pilot going on in battery storage. So just about every relevant, I talked a little bit earlier in the earnings call about the partnership in carbon capture. So just about anything you want to do in sustainability and renewable economy of the future, we also do. So weâre going to benefit from both sides of this energy transition, and you see it in the bookings right this quarter.
Darius Adamczyk: Yes. So maybe let me take the first one Yes, I mean I think in terms of recovery on our supply chain broadly, itâs going to be very, very gradual. There is no sort of a magic unlock thatâs going to happen in one quarter and all of a sudden, everything will now sort of get flushed through our backlogs and so on. I think itâs been very gradual. Sort of the de-commits youâre probably referring to, because I gave some specific numbers on that in last quarter around aerospace. And just to give you a little bit of an update on that. Q1 was at 22.5%, 23% in that range. Q2 was better, but it wasnât as good as we had hoped. It came in at just a shade over 21% on the de-commits, so better than Q1, but we were kind of hoping something around the 19% to 20% range. But we saw improvement. We expect that improvement to continue gradually. We also saw about a 3% improvement in output Q-over-Q. So overall, some level of progress, but itâs going to be gradual. And thatâs kind of what weâre penciling in for the next few quarters, which is gradual level of improvement, both in the semi space as well as some of the aerospace supply chain. Thatâs kind of what our standard case is. We hope for the better. Weâve deployed a small army into the supply chain, particularly in the Aerospace segment to help our suppliers get up to rate. But itâs challenging because itâs not sort of just the suppliers that are kind of, letâs call them, Tier 3 suppliers that really feed us to the Tier 4 and even Tier 5 suppliers that are struggling. And this problem will be solved. I have no doubt it will solved, but there is no instant gratification.
Darius Adamczyk: And, Deane, as you know, weâve absorbed sort of the FX impact as well into our guidance range, which was nickel on the EPS range, and on a year-over-year basis, actually a $0.14 headwind, so.
Darius Adamczyk: Okay. I just want to thank all of our shareholders for your ongoing support. We delivered strong second quarter results in typical Honeywell fashion. We have and we will continue to overcome the numerous external factors we face with operational rigor and agility in order to drive superior shareholder returns. Thank you all for listening, and please stay safe and healthy.
Greg Lewis: We figured -- itâs -- we were down 1 in UOP and itâs -- 7 points of that is Russia. So itâs plus 6...
Greg Lewis: Sure, sure. So I think what youâre going to see as we go through the remainder of the year is, as you mentioned, 3Q is going to look a lot like 2Q, broadly speaking. And as we get into Q4, weâre going to get our normal sort of seasonal uplift in revenue, which brings along with that some nice fixed cost leverage. On top of that, weâre going to get some mix favorability. We expect UOP, in particular, to be very strong in Q4. You know that our PMT margins can be pretty lumpy with individual UOP catalyst shipments moving that needle, and we have a pretty strong Q4 plugged in there. And we are also taking some cost actions in SPS in particular, where weâve talked to you about the relative challenges in top line. So thatâs how I would think about the setup as we go into the back half.
Greg Lewis: Yes. I would just say we printed something in the 26-ish range in Q2, and I would expect that to stay in that neighborhood through the remainder of the year kind of directionally. Weâll probably get again a little bit of a lift in Q4 with some extra volume. But previously, we had thought that would be a little bit more robust with a higher revenue profile. But as I discussed earlier, thatâs where weâre probably on the lower end of our range of expectations of supply chain healing and output. And so just a little bit of volume leverage loss relative to the high end of what we had hopefully.
Greg Lewis: Sure. So youâre right, we talked about 5% for the year a quarter ago. We now see that as being more like an 8% number for 2022. So nice progress for the first 2 quarters, and that kind of carrying through. Pricing our backlog has been something thatâs been very important to us. Obviously, thatâs got a lot more challenges to it than new orders coming in. But we have been successful in doing that in certain areas of the portfolio. So we expect to be able to retain a good bit of that pricing. I think we found that our pricing has been very sticky over time.
Greg Lewis: Yes. I would say when we look at it, there are some commodities that are seeing some of that deflation. But overall, for our total portfolio of direct materials, thatâs sort of cherry picking. And overall, we still see a net increase.
Greg Lewis: Yes. And then on the Russia side, Deane, I mean, Iâd say we have taken the bulk of the write-downs associated with our balance sheet as it relates to Russia in the first quarter. That was really around our unbilled receivables in the second quarter. We took down essentially all of our PP&E and any other related assets down to essentially zero at this point. What weâre really working through now is just the cash implications of all of that, and itâs going to be a legal matter that will probably take quarters and -- well into 2023 as all of the aspects of sanctions on export control compliance comes into play. So itâs just not going to be a simple wind down. But from a write-down perspective, I would say the bulk of it has happened at this point.
