Dave Cote: Well I think what we could say, it’s a pretty fast turning business Jeff, as you probably know. So we really don’t look at a book development. If you look at the fares revenues, and I think I mentioned this, ETRs fares revenue were up 13% in the quarter of 5% sequentially. If you look at the BGAs fares, those were up 37% in the quarter, up 6% sequentially. Now for ATR what we expect in the fourth quarter is continuation of that strengthening, in fact, we expect even stronger performance on the ATR side of the business in the fourth quarter. So the other positive thing as we talked about is that RNO is now increasing, is now growing. And given that that’s 2/3 of our ATR aftermarket, that’s very significant. And we would expect again in the fourth quarter the total ATR aftermarket to grow at double the rate of flight hour growth. Now we expect recoupling to begin, we could see some continued favorability that is fares and RNO combined, outpacing flight hours during the early part of 011. But we expect overall, for 011 a recoupling that is if you will, a linear relationship more like the historic relationship between revenue growth in our aftermarket, commercial aftermarket, and global flying hours.Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: Separately, and unrelated, just on Sperian, what’s the outlook for Q4, are we neutral or do we have some more dilution in Q4.
Dave Cote: We anticipate slight dilution in Q4, about a penny.Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research Partners: Great, thanks a lot guys.
Dave Cote: I think the other thing, Dave, maybe just to add to that is that two things, I think in the quarter that Steve, hopefully also gives support to Dave’s comment. One as I mentioned as I went through the material is the impact obviously, the Sperian acquisition, and we’re always going to be doing acquisitions etc., but the fact of the matter this was fairly significant in terms of its diluted impact. If you adjust for M&A, just take that out of the equation, look at the operating performance, ACS was up 40 basis points in margin in the quarter. Despite the fact that it absorbed an important portion of that $200 million of labor cost headwind on a year-over-year basis, so operating performance was very good. It masked the fact that ACS in the quarter had very good productivity, and all the things, all the attributes, if you did the walk in terms of their margin rates, all the things that you would want to go right, did go right for ACS in the quarter. So it really is those two factors that influenced it. And to Dave’s point, the underlining fundamentals are just getting stronger. The commercial excellence elements of ACS, the success rate of new products, what we’re doing importantly in terms of the rate of growth that they’re experiencing, in both the tradition or traditional market Steve, as well as in emerging markets. All of that support margin expansion for ACS over time.
Dave Cote: And John, you’ve heard me say this before, but I always think there’s opportunity for restructuring, and if there isn’t, it probably means you stop thinking because nobody ever has perfect plans, perfect organizations, perfect processes. And we’re going to continue to look for opportunities when we have gains of deploying them smartly. But that part’s not going to change, and I still think there’s a lot more opportunity in the company.

But that part’s not going to change, and I still think there’s a lot more opportunity in the company. 
Dave Cote: Thanks Elena, well we continue to outperform, it’s for the same reasons we keep driving those key themes having great positions and good industries, one Honeywell and our five initiatives. Free cash flow has been just terrific and I think it’s a real reflection of our earnings quality, and as you know, our cash performance has been an impressive for a long time now because as we focus on it. We’re excited about out prospects in the future and next year, even in a slow growth economy. We’re going to keep doing what we have been doing, and that’s relentlessly executing our consistent strategy, day by day, week by week over the years. And it’s amazing where you can get to by just consistently executing smart strategies. It’s our intent with our performance to make all of you look brilliant in owning Honeywell, thanks.
Dave Anderson: Absolutely, it’s sustainable. This is – what you’re starting to see is the result of years of effort, it’s not something that you do overnight, and it goes back to having great positions in good industries, making sure that we’re doing a good job on understanding commercially what’s going on. The new products, the new services that we’re introducing, the focus that we’ve had on organization efficacy, the OEF that we’ve talked about before, the indirect management, it’s all those things. You start working on them, you don’t see the results right away, but once you get the trend going, if you will, get the [inaudible] moving in a different direction, it’s really pretty darn good.
Dave Anderson: I think flattish could be a very good outcome, and we’re going to plan for it to be worse than that. I think that’s a smart thing to do, and yes you can restructure. You can also make sure that you built your capability in places that are going to do well, and I think over time we will continue to see BGA bounce back, our business jets bounce back, and on the large commercial that will bounce back. But I think the smart thing to do when you think about defense, is to assume that it’s going to – flat would be good. And that’s the way we’re going to think about it.
Dave Anderson: Well, we look at that with every one of our businesses, and as I think I’ve said before, I don’t get to cranked up over market share, because I’m always concerned that you do well in market share by defining the denominator, and that causes people to not be as thoughtful as they could be. And what we tend to do is look at the overall versus kind of the industry generally, and I think when you take a look at our revenue growth for example, this quarter versus peers, I think you’d have to say we’ve done pretty darn well and it’s a good reflection that what we’re doing is working. And what we want to do is just make sure we’re growing sales faster than everybody else. Now there are some who still are a little bit better, but overall, I think we’re doing pretty well there.
Dave Anderson: The prospects for growth in that business are huge. And going back to where we were 7 or 8 years ago, Bob, I’m sure you remember we kept saying it’s a buy [inaudible] portfolio and we needed to extract ourselves from a bunch of places, actually about 40%, and build on the remainder. We’ve done that, and I’m excited about the prospects in that business both for sales growth and margin growth, and I’d say Andres and his team are doing a very nice job of focusing that business on all the places they can grow. So I’m not going to put any numbers on it, like I never do, but I like it.
Dave Anderson: What’s really a – as I said, 100 basis points reduction of the discount rate. You know, that phenomenon is really close to the spike in the expense.
Dave Anderson: Sure. What we did last year, John, is for it to hold in the normal way you call merit or salary increases, pay increases last year in light of the recession. We cut back significantly on incentive compensation and we had a number of work-schedule reductions/furloughs. So in combination, the total, if you will, policy-related labor cost actions that we took in light of the 15% revenue decline that we experienced last year that totaled that $600 million when you compare the non-repeat of those actions; for example, work-schedule reductions or furloughs not happening we’re not having the same degree this year. The reinstatement of merit or salary increases towards the later part of this is, as well as accruing now at more normal rates, historic levels or near-historic levels in terms of incentive compensation, the combination of those three represent headwinds to the financial statement. 
Dave Anderson: Yes. Okay, so remember when we went through our cost actions, over $900 million of cost actions we had a significant portion that were structural that were costed out that don’t come back. You know, what we’re doing is working, obviously this your and you’re seeing it in our results, is we’re offsetting or mitigating the year-over-year impact of the – this labor-cost actions last year with additional productivity.  So you know, all things that we’re doing, continue to do to drive cost performance and productivity to the company are paying off and you’re seeing that in the margin expansion of the company. But the margin expansion is – it will, on a full-year-basis, will be muted, particularly in the second half will be muted by those labor-cost actions.  Therefore, in 2011, we won’t that same kind of incumbrance, if you will. 
Dave Anderson: Well, there’s two questions there John. Number one, the $150 million operating income [inaudible] for 2011 relative to 2010 is driven by restructuring actions we’ve taken to date. 
Dave Anderson: In 2010. So that’s – that’s a very good news story. The other really good news story is that $72 million restructuring that we took in the third quarter, 54, other than Sperian, plus 18 for Sperian, that restructuring has really paid for, not in total, but if nearly entirely paid for by a $62 million gain that we had on the JB consolidation that I referenced.  So we’re smartly using gains to fund obviously cost structure and improve upgrade performance going forward.   Relative to what you anticipate for next year, we would use the same sort of planning assumption or guidance for next years – for this year, which is about $50 million. In other words, sort of a nominal amount in terms of – thinking – in terms of thinking about repositioning with additional repositioning coming about as a result of smart deployment of gains. 
Dave Anderson: I’ve got two questions. Number one, $150 million of operating income benefit that have been cited for 2011 relative to 2010, is driven by the restructuring actions, we’ve taken to date in 2010. So that’s a very good news story, the other really good news story, if I could just add a sub point, is that $72 million restructuring that we took in the third quarter, 54 other than Sperian plus 18 for Sperian, that restructuring is really paid for, not in total, but it’s nearly entirely paid for by the $62 million gain that we had on the [inaudible] consolidation that I referenced.  So we’re smartly using gains to fund, to improve obviously cost structure and improved uplink performance going forward. Relative to what you had anticipate for next year, we would use the same sort of planning and [inaudible] guidance for next year as we did for this year which is about $50 million. In other words, sort of a phenomenal amount in terms of think about, in terms of repositioning, with additional repositioning coming about as a result of smart deployment of gains most likely.
Dave Anderson: Sure. What we did last year, John, is for it to hold in the normal way you call merit or salary increases, pay increases last year in light of the recession. We cut back significantly on incentive compensation and we had a number of work-schedule reductions/furloughs.

In other words, sort of a nominal amount in terms of – thinking – in terms of thinking about repositioning with additional repositioning coming about as a result of smart deployment of gains. 
Dave Anderson: Well, you know, the key thing you’ve got here is a couple of things going on. Number one, we talked we’ve got the labor cost headwinds so we look at the absolute numbers, you’ve got that. So we look at year-over-year, I’ll say close to that number Steve. The other thing you’ve got is, we’ve got anticipated higher launch contributions for Aerospace in the fourth quarter, we’ve got kind of our biggest [inaudible] coming up in terms of launch. So we’ll still see, when we kill the numbers back and look at the underlining operational performance, you’ll still see very nice growth on a year-over-year basis.
Dave Anderson: We’ll update that for you in December. The contributions that we’re looking at are obviously going to be influenced by the level of contribution that we make here in the fourth quarter as well as what we do in 2011. And we’re still working through that Steve, so we’ll give you an update on that – and we can do that on the multi-year basis. Kind of a range estimate as we’ve done in the past when we give December guidance.
Dave Anderson: It will be less than that, and that’s consistent with the OEF focus we’ve had. Because when you look at OEF, it comprises a number of things. It’s not just the number of people, it’s also where are you adding those people, what kind of revenue are you generating with them, what the comp is, what the benefits are, there’s a lot that goes into it. The more I think, holistic look at how are you managing that, at the same time, having the best people motivated and organized the right way. So we – yes, I would say in general, I would expect we’ll be adding because the demand is there. The demand for that product and services. But we’ll be adding at a lower rate than we had revenue.
Dave Anderson: You know the aftermarket is a very important and profitable piece of the business, Nigel. You know that we don’t comment on specific margin rates in terms of sub-segments or products within Aerospace but it’s very, very important. And a key driver for our outlook, we’re encouraged as we said but the fact that the announcing double digit growth on the ATR fares, in addition to strong double digit on business aviation fares, and the RNO piece of the business is now starting to grow, although modestly. But that will pick up and then again, together we expect those to recouple with global flying hours. That – you can kind of model that in terms of your assumptions, as you want to pick it, but for the fourth quarter we’re looking at kind of high team kind of numbers in terms of overall after market for the business.
