Jerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, Lyndsey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Rollins delivered another good quarter of growth and profitability, reflecting consistent execution of our operating strategies and continuous improvement in our business. Our financial performance for the first quarter was highlighted by an increase in revenue of nearly 14% to $748 million. We delivered healthy organic growth of 7.5% in the quarter despite some unfavorable and erratic weather in January compared to last year, which Ken will discuss in more detail.  Overall, we continued to see double-digit revenue growth across all major service lines as total Residential revenue increased 16.5%, Commercial rose 11.4% and Termite was up 11.7% this quarter. We continue to invest in growing our business. As you would expect, we invested in incremental sales staffing and marketing activities ahead of peak season to ensure that we are well positioned and top of mind for the consumer as pet season begins. We are well staffed on the technician and customer support front, so that people are onboarded, extensively trained and ready to provide an exceptional level of service for our customers.  On the commercial side of the business, we are leveraging analytics to identify areas in the market where opportunity warrants additional resources. And this continues to pay dividends as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit commercial growth. We continue to strategically add feet on the street to our sales force and are leveraging our training and sales tools to better enable their success as well. Investments to drive organic growth are complemented by strategic M&A. April 1 marked the 1-year anniversary of closing the Fox acquisition, and that team has performed exceptionally well. We anticipate that Fox will continue to positively impact organic growth and profitability as we go forward.  We closed 12 tuck-in deals in the first 3 months of the year, and the M&A pipeline remains healthy. We're actively evaluating acquisition opportunities, both domestically and internationally, and remain on track to deliver at least 2% of growth from M&A activity in 2024. Beyond growth, our dedication to operational efficiency and continuous improvement is an important part of our strategy and culture. Ken will discuss in more detail, but we saw a healthy margin improvement in the quarter as we executed our pricing strategy, leveraged our cost structure and drove efficiencies throughout the business.  Safety remains an important area of focus for us and efforts to enhance safety coaching, training and protocols resulted in higher driving safety scores and fewer recorded safety incidents when compared to a year ago. In closing, we're excited about where our business stands today. This year is off to a solid start, and demand from our customers remains strong with over 7% organic growth in the first quarter. Our markets are solid, staffing levels are healthy, and our team is focused on driving continuous improvement and profitable growth. I want to thank each of our 19,000-plus team members around the world for their ongoing commitment to our customers.  Before I hand it over to Ken, I'd like to announce a few changes to our Board of Directors. First, we would like to thank Jerry Nix, who recently retired from our Board, for his service to our company. We've been so fortunate to have Jerry as our Lead Director for the past several years. His experience, wisdom and guidance helped us navigate uncharted waters for our company, and we're incredibly grateful for the significant contributions he's made along the way.  Second, we would like to welcome Dale Jones, who was elected to our Board at a recent shareholder meeting. Additionally, Louise Sams has been appointed as our new Lead Independent Director. We're excited about the level of expertise and experience that both Dale and Louise will bring to our Board in their new roles. Ken, I'll now turn the call over to you. 
Jerry Gahlhoff: Tim, this is Jerry. A lot of that cost really lied on the heavier side on the selling expense as it relates to us staffing up. Let me give you a couple of examples, a couple of data points. Just looking at Orkin alone, when we looked compared to prior year in the first quarter, we had over 50 more commercial account managers at Orkin alone. We had over 100 more home sales inspectors at Orkin in the first quarter of this year than we did the last year.  So that's where a lot of our investment continues to be. We see that opportunity. That's what I referred to as the feet on the street opportunity. So our sales salaries are up there. It's not necessarily some sort of targeted defensive marketing spend. It's an offensive sales mobilization and really building out your sales team for the growth opportunities ahead. 
Jerry Gahlhoff: I would add to that, George, that when we think about some of the onetime business as well, as Ken mentioned, it's usually choppier in the shoulder seasons when weather -- that's an area of the business that weather can impact more so than anything, but you still have your recurring customer base that's there to service. But we also continue to see really strong health in our onetime ancillary business that really shows that a consumer side of it is strong and the consumers continue to be willing to invest in protecting their homes. 
Jerry Gahlhoff: I look at it from a productivity standpoint. We continue to -- the sales are there, the working the backlog can be a challenge. And in the quarter -- and that goes back to a January type of phenomenon, where we had more branches and operations closed for multiple days compared to the prior year. And that affects productivity and ability to get the work done, even if our sales force is out there selling and they're out there continuing to do what they do and building that backlog of work to get done.  And so the work is there for us to get done. So we're optimistic about that. It's not a selling issue. It's us getting all the workload done in a given period of time. So when you carry a backlog over into the second quarter, things still look healthy. That helps, to add any color. 
Jerry Gahlhoff: I know it sounds like a broken record and we've said this now for a few years. We just continue to invest in our sales staff, getting them ramped up and being successful. That B2B sales process is a relationship type of sale. It's got a long selling cycle, and you got to be patient, you got to invest. You got to invest in training and sales tools and supporting those new account managers when they're brought up to get them ramped up and brought to speed just as fast as possible.   That is the more you add in the sales force and the more investments you make to make them successful. We just continue to see that opportunity there. So I wouldn't say there's anything magical about it other than being committed to continue to add incrementally to our sales force. 
Jerry Gahlhoff: We haven't seen any significant change from a retention issue one way or the other. So that remains pretty solid and any color on April... 
Jerry Gahlhoff: Yes, I agree with you, Ken. I think it's hard to predict that. I mean, there's going to be movement in any of those categories potentially based on a number of factors and where it all comes out in that 7% to 8% total. 
Jerry Gahlhoff: We had a lot more carrying costs from people side in late fourth quarter and certainly in the first quarter than I think we've ever had. The reality is it's certainly harder to find people and then with the level of intensity that we put and the time and energy that we put into training and development upfront, that takes time to have people ready. And so our strategy has been to get ahead of that. 
Jerry Gahlhoff: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in our company and look forward to speaking with you all at our upcoming investor conference. Thanks again. 
Kenneth Krause: Thanks for the question, Tim. I appreciate that. And when looking at the business, we certainly did see some improvements as we went throughout the quarter. But one quarter is certainly not a long-term trend. We are continuing to remain very confident in our outlook, and that outlook is really anchored around 7% to 8% sort of growth rate that we've consistently talked about. That stepped up, as you all know, since COVID, and we continue to benefit from that higher growth rate and more favorable operating environment. But yes, I think 7% to 8% is kind of how we think about the business from an organic basis going forward. 
Kenneth Krause: Certainly. When we look at the residential business, we look at the residential business very broadly across our residential services as well as our termite and ancillary. Across that portfolio, the business continues to perform very well. Onetime business can be choppy. It continues to be choppy. But generally, demand for our services remains very healthy.  As I indicated in my prepared commentary, what we saw when we look just at the residential business alone, we saw an improvement, 4.3% growth for the quarter but close to 8% growth as we look at February and March. So we continue to see really good demand levels for our business. 
Kenneth Krause: Certainly, when you unpack the termite business, there's 2 components to the termite and ancillary. There is your normal recurring termite business, your pretreat business, and then you have ancillary business in there as well. We're seeing really good demand across the spectrum. Our business, our recurring bait monitoring business, continues to grow at a very healthy level, but also our ancillary business in that area continues to grow as well at a nice rate. So it's really a broad-based growth that we're seeing in demand for our services. 
Kenneth Krause: It's interesting. When I step back and I look at the financials, and I look at the trend in spend across different categories of SG&A, Jerry is spot on, sales salaries continues to be an area that we continue to invest disproportionately in. We're saving money in some of the back office costs and admin areas, but we continue to invest pretty heavily on the front end of our business and taking a very offensive perspective on our business. 
Kenneth Krause: It would be very difficult to grow our business at the rate we're growing if we saw [ chiding ] in customer churn. And so customer churn, although it is not [ chiding ], it still remains an opportunity for us to continue to improve. When we look at April, we continue to see healthy levels of demand. We're starting April strongly. But again, we continue to think about a 7% to 8% sort of organic growth rate across the business as we think about the future. 
Kenneth Krause: When we look at the pipeline, it's very healthy. It's very balanced. There's opportunities across the spectrum with respect to M&A. Something that we have consistently said, however, for 2024, is that we do think that 2% to 3% of revenue growth is probably a realistic expectation of contribution from M&A.  We continue to look at deals. We continue to evaluate deals. And in fact, in Q1, we spent roughly $45 million to $50 million on M&A, and that was up considerably year-over-year. Of course, last year, we were preparing for Fox. But I think it just shows that there continues to be a very healthy pipeline of M&A in a very fragmented market that we continue to compete in. 
Kenneth Krause: It's interesting when you start to put a fine point on that, but we do think that probably commercial and termite and ancillary will probably grow a little bit faster than the overall average and resi might grow a little bit slower. You just have puts and takes across the portfolio. It doesn't mean that we're not bullish in residential, but I just think that, that's generally how the growth profile has unfolded over time for us. 
Kenneth Krause: Yes. As we had talked about, I mean, the business started to grow pretty nicely on a year-over-year basis, organic basis in February and into the March. And so we saw that, and we saw an opportunity to pull forward some investments. It doesn't mean that we're going to invest any lighter in Q2. In fact, we're going to continue to invest in Q2 and drive further growth.  The market opportunity is there and you've got to invest when that market opportunity is there. This is a very short cycle business. And when you see weather patterns that improve or demand trends that might change, you have to be ready to invest. And so I think that's just -- it's just reflective of our investment and our interest in investing in growth across our portfolio. 
Kenneth Krause: So looking at your questions, thank you for your questions. The first question with respect to pricing, it's interesting. When we step back and we look at this business, I think recently, you've heard me start to talk about this as a CPI-plus type of business. So we think this service is certainly an essential service and should command CPI-plus level pricing. So 3% to 4% this year is certainly -- it's something we passed along, and we're seeing it stick. We just feel like the service is just too valuable, not to price it at those levels.  And then secondly, when you look at the SG&A levels across the business, it's good to see the improvements that we're seeing in our cost structure. I think in the quarter, we talked about a 20 basis point improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales. But when you unpack that, you see that we spent roughly 50 basis points more on growth-oriented investments but 70 basis points less of back office costs.  And I think that's representative of the work we're doing to improve the effectiveness and the productivity of our business. We feel like there's more to come, but we certainly are happy with the progress we're making there. 
Kenneth Krause: Yes, it was 10.8% to put a fine point on it for the entire company. And for residential, it was 8%.
