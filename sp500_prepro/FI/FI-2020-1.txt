Mike Kearney: So I've got Steve Russell here also to help us with the Q&A. And since that's a great operational question, we'll let Steve take that one.
Mike Kearney: Yes. I'll start on that, George, and then let Melissa pick up on it. DSO is reducing itâ€™s really quite a complex issue, without belaboring it, it all starts with the contract, you sign invoicing term. We invoice in a number of locations globally. And you've got customers that are changing their payables systems, it seems like almost monthly. And sometimes we get delays where an operator says, yes gee we can't pay you for the next 30 or 45 days because we're controlling the system.So it gets really, really complex. But I can tell you, I personally over the next few months, I'm going to be working with the rest of the management team to really focus on working capital management, particularly our AR collections. But as I said, it's a continuum of activities, from contracting, getting your correct invoice out the door, and then making sure if the customer pays. And they can be slow and sloppy sometimes.So it's a complicated continuum. And we're going to work every piece of that along the way. Melissa, I don't know, if you want to add something from your side.
Mike Kearney: Yes, thanks very much. And I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today on the call and your interest in Frank's International and we look forward to providing another update next quarter. Good bye.
