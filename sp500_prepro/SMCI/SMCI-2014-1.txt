Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. Last quarter’s results indicated that Super Micro is off to a strong start for this fiscal year. Many of our popular product line performed strongly. Our leadership in innovative architecture and optimized total solutions are firmly in place. I am confident that we will continue our growth trends in the coming quarters and years. Operator at this time, we are ready for questions.
Charles Liang: Okay, I mean, I’d just say anytime there are economic transition, it’s a good window for Super Micro to grow. And Ivy Bridge basically will provide some opportunities as well. So because our [regional launch] was September around 15th, September 10th, right? So it’s kind of pretty much end of last quarter. So not much impact to last quarter, but we are having more impact to this quarter, I mean December quarter. And we have kind of strong product liability, I mean other than Ivy Bridge. So our December quarter and next coming quarters, I believe will be a strong way.
Charles Liang: And that’s why it’s very important we continue to a stronger aggressive debate, specifically our manpower in Asia.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
