Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of growth, we saw very solid growth, very good growth in Q1, up 23% on a local currency basis. North-America we saw a similar growth rates in Q1 as we saw in Q4 of last year as well as Q1 of last year all at 26%. And then international we saw the growth accelerate a little bit on a exchange adjusted basis from 15% to 18% from Q4 to Q1. But we really seen is we are pleased with the overall fundamentals we continue to add new customers and stocks continues to be healthy, third party unit is a percentage of units are above 40% still very strong FBA adoption, that continues to be strong around the world, continued to add new selection. We saw strong growth in many different areas including Web Services, and so again a lot of different areas contributed to growth rate that we saw in Q1. In terms of Prime Pantry, we just think it’s an exciting option for prime numbers that’s available only to prime numbers, and so they can get their everyday non-bulk items in one box, and we think that’s – its’ interesting for customers and again it’s great way that we can add the selection and have the selections for those customers.
Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of pricing, we’ve been very consistent. We want to offer great value to customers, and so I would work very hard to make sure that we can offer and afford to offer great prices for customers. And so, that’s something that we’ve been working on in the very hard over the years and that’s certainly one of the reason why you’ve seen the growth rates that we’ve experienced a long with getting close to customers, from the shipping perspective make sure we have great in stocks and other service attributes. In terms of price increases, we certainly have increased the price on Prime, but again that was after many years of not raising the price even though the cost of transportation costs certainly had gone up and the fact that we have certainly added a lot of selection going from little over 1 million items in the first year to over 20 million items. So it’s still an incredibly great value for customers and that’s why we did that. So again, we’re all about making sure we have great values for customers and we’ll continue to that.Aram H. Rubinson – Wolfe Research LLC: Okay thanks for that.
Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of AWS, the team is doing a fantastic job. We are adding a lot of resources that we’ve grown our employee-based there dramatically over the years and continue to add people there. And that’s the way we’ve been able to launch all the new services that we had over the past several years. And we continued the pace of acceleration in terms of new things that we’re doing is increasing and we’ve published a lot of statistics around that. In terms of pricing, we think this is our 42nd pricing increase that we had in AWS. Sorry price decrease in AWS and we’re very excited behalf of customers to be able to do that. The team works very hard to able to afford those lower prices and we’re excited to do that. And so in terms of the timing of when we launched these price decreases, they come at different times and that happened to come in the presentation that we’re giving around that time. So but again we’re excited about the opportunity and we’re continuing invest in that business, given the big opportunity that we have there.
Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of video content, the team does a very nice job of various modeling, certainly we are trying to estimate what the usages of those of all the content that we’ve launched. And we have a number of different ways if you do that. We do have certainly for some of the content that we have been selling both in terms of physical format as well as selling on the transactional side. We certainly see what the – what those sales are, what those unit sales are. So we have that as a benchmark, we also have other models to look at that to help us guide to we think the usage that will be those. But again the team has done a nice job and I am looking at different ways to model that. And I expect it will continue to refine that overtime as well.Ben Schachter – Macquarie Capital, Inc.: And the Kindle Fire TV.
Thomas J. Szkutak: Yes, in terms of Fire TV, I can’t talk about the economics of the device itself. But what I can say is it’s very early and we are extremely pleased with what see and just the few weeks here and the team certainly made we think it’s a killer product and where the team is very hard trying to keep buying stock in their product.
Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of prime, it’s early but we are encouraged with what we see so far. Just over the last several weeks, our prime subscribers continue to grow week-over-week. New trials, the adoption of new trials again post the increase are growing very nicely. So those customers accepting new trials is growing very fast. We only have a few days of information related to conversion. And we are encouraged by what we see there. So overall we are very encouraged and the reason why is the customers we believe are responding to just a great service. And so we are continuously being reminded that for customers in terms of the offering we have in the physical side as well as the offerings that we have in the digital side as well. So we are very encouraged there. In terms of the North American media, we did see from a growth standpoint, it’s 13%year-over-year for North American media that compares to 14% in Q1 of last year. It is down a little bit sequentially from Q4 – Q4 keep in mind we do have video games and video consoles in that number in Q4. And there is certainly number of different factors, but that certainly one that is impacting the Q4 numbers. And it’s certainly seasonal as you would expect that there is some great launches of consoles in Q4 that are impacting that number.
Thomas J. Szkutak: Sure as you mentioned unit growth was actually decelerated a little bit from Q4 and also from last year with 23% year-over-year in Q1. One thing to keep in mind is that our web services business is growing at a faster rate. We don’t incorporate any units from AWS in that metric. But overall, you’re right we continue to – from a growth standpoint we had a small acceleration of growth from Q4 to Q1 from a revenue standpoint, again on local currency basis going from 22% to 23%, we are very pleased with the fundamentals that I talked about earlier that’s impacting that growth rate. So again overall we are pleased and again we think that we see a nice growth rate, and third-party units as a percentage of total units is 40%, which was consistent with what we saw last year so, third-party growth continues to be very strong as well.
Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the – I’ll take the second part of the question first about International media, the growth rate was 4% in the quarter and as I’ve talked about in prior quarters, certainly one of the things that’s happening is we see a conversion from physical to digital. And for example in North-America we are now selling North-America media. We are now selling more digital units than physical units. So over the past twelve months we sold more digital units than physical units. We are not at that point yet in International and so certainly that’s an opportunity for us as we look at growing International media. So again, it’s certainly something that we are working very hard on and certainly a good opportunity for us. In terms of unit growth, it’s certainly just one measure that we want to – that we’ve thought has been helpful. And that’s why we’ve continued to provide it. It is just one metric, we have many different metrics that we are sharing. But that much more I can add to that but again it’s a metric, was there a third part of the question.
Thomas J. Szkutak: It’s not that I can think of at the minute. But just keep in mind when you think about our revenue growth always be thinking about there’s certainly a volume component. We have a third-party component, we have a mix component. We’re continuously trading the lower prices for customers. All those factor into the revenue growth rates that you see into the revenue metrics that we provide to you.
Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of fulfillment, there’s not a lot I can comment on in terms of your specific question. What I would say though is we continue to work to be, as we have over the years, to become closer and closer to customers. And so, we’ve certainly done that in a number of different ways. Just the footprint we have from a fulfillment capacity standpoint enables us to be closer to customers and getting great selection even closer to customers. So we continue to work. Certainly Prime was another way to get a faster delivery speed to customers and so we’ll continue to work on our capabilities there to make it even better over time. In terms of the digital units question, I apologize. There’s not a lot I can comment in terms of your specific question there.Brian J. Pitz – Jefferies LLC: All right. Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak: Unfortunately it is probably a good question for future quarters it just so early and again what little data we have so far it’s very encouraging but it is very early so I think that’s – it’s a good question for future quarters.
Thomas J. Szkutak: I think the best way to say it is, and hopefully this answers your question. The team focuses on many different aspects, but certainly the operational aspects of being up and running, being a very secure, reliable set of services, those are something the team is very focused on and spends a lot of time working on. And so beyond that, I’m not sure I can add to it.Heath P. Terry – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks, Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak: There’s a number of factors. Certainly we have a number of different arrangements where we have exclusive content and we think that’s great for customers. We’ve also supplemented with other content that’s not exclusive. And we’re obviously, as you know, we’re working on original content as well. So that is exclusive. So those are the things that we’re working on and we see the customer response to all of those and we like what we see.Youssef H. Squali – Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thanks
Thomas J. Szkutak: Domestic fulfillment, as we have in past years, we’ll continue to update you as we go throughout the year. I don’t have any comments today given that we’re just coming out of Q1, but we will be adding fulfillment capacity given the growth rates we’re experiencing and we’ll update you as we go.Ronald Scott Tilghman – B. Riley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak: I can’t comment on what we might or might not do in the future, but the team has done a nice job from an advertising perspective and you can see those prominently on our various websites. We view it as another way certainly to help, be able to afford lower prices for customers and again the team has done a very nice job of monetizing those detailed pages to allow us to be able to do that.
Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the second part of the question, related to the guidance what’s reflected in the Q2 guidance is many different factors, but we are investing. I’ve mentioned a number of different investments that we’re making in International which related to Q1, also relate to Q2. We are investing in content, we are investing in our web services business both from new services as well as pricing. So again, we are investing in a lot of different areas across the company. So I’m sure there is a number that I’m not mentioning. So again, we are investing, that’s really which we are seeing in the range of guidance that we see in Q2. In terms of International media, we continue to make progress there on our conversion from physical to digital. But we’re just not where we are in North America. And it’s in many different categories and we’ll continue to work on that. And certainly some other things that you see related to video in Europe, certainly trying to address that part of that. So again, we’ll continue to work on the various pieces of that for our International business and look forward to doing that.Mark S. Mahaney – RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks, Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak: In China, we are investing a lot and trying to grow the business there. We are certainly investing in fulfillment. We haven’t been investing in our fulfillment network to get even closer to customers. We are doing a lot on the retail basics as we’ve done in other geographies making sure that we have a great in stock availability. We’re making sure that we have [had] a unique selection. So those are the, lot of the things that we’ve done making sure that we have the right pricing in place on behalf of customers making sure that our service levels are where we need them to be. So those are the things that we’d continue to work on in China. It’s a very large opportunity and we are continuing to work hard. Is it a large investment? Yes it is. And that investment has certainly increased over the past several years.
Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the just clarification and just quote, he mentioned that customers will be saving hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several months alone, he didn’t say specifically at the second quarter. So certainly that’s impacting second quarter and it’s reflected in the guidance that you are seeing there. But again we are very happy to do that on behalf of our AWS customers. We’ve done many different price decreases over time and we think that’s great on behalf of customers and we think our teams are and we are positioned very well in that business and we continue to invest in that given the large opportunity that we have there. In terms of the other question, there is not really a lot I can comment there.
Thomas J. Szkutak: In terms of Prime, again over the year-over-year, it is growing very rapidly and then also week-over-week as we look at the metrics over the last several weeks continues to grow week-over-week, so we’re very encouraged by what we’re seeing there. In terms of mobile, it’s certainly a tailwind for our business. We have a number of different things that are working on mobile and we continue to make it easier and easier for customers to shop from a mobile perspective. Our traffic continues to increase from a mobile perspective. We are excited about what we see there. And we continue trying to find ways to make that even better from an experience standpoint for our customers.
