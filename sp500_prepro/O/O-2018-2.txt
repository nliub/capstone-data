John Case: Sure, Josh. I think that sort of the topic of the day is Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack and what the impact it’s going [technical difficulty] industry. PillPack has about five [technical difficulty] overall market share today, focus on drugs, treating long-term conditions [technical difficulty]about 25% of pharmacy sales, 50% of the drugs are for acute illnesses and 25% are for specialty drugs and these are typically handled by the brick-and-mortar pharmacies. So, PillPack is suitable for relatively small portion of the market. Walgreens and CVS are top two drugstore tenants, each have about 23% of the market. And both have been very successful recently, having positive same-store pharmacy sales for the last five years. Most consumers of drugs, based on surveys and industry trade information prefer face-to-face interaction when purchasing drugs. These are the older -- this is the older portion of our population, the baby [technical difficulty] Walgreens and CVS have become competitive on pricing [technical difficulty] integration alliances with PBMs. So, that’s helped them capture more market share [technical difficulty] also able to create captive market share through this vertical integration. And both, Walgreens and CVS offer same day and overnight delivery [technical difficulty] and or delivery in major markets today and continue to [technical difficulty] FedEx and Walgreens have formed a venture specifically for this purpose. Another statistic that gives us comfort is since 2010, brick and mortar drug stores have taken about 20% of the market share from mail order pharmacies. And again, this is due to them becoming more price competitive [technical difficulty]and out of convenience. 80% of the [technical difficulty] lives within a 5 miles of CVS or Walgreens, and the two -- the top two brick-and-mortar pharmacies continue to add in-house health clinics to drive pharmacy sales. So, we see that trend continuing and growing and having a positive impact on those brick-and-mortar businesses. The overall pharmacy market is growing by 5% per year, expected to continue to grow at a nice straight around 5%. There were [technical difficulty] not surprising to see new entrants. I’d say, importantly, our pharmacies are in outstanding real estate solutions that are fungible. And while our investment in the industry has declined by about 1.5% in the last 18 months, based on growth in other areas and selective asset sales, we remain really confident in the [technical difficulty] and specifically [technical difficulty]. So, we’re certainly comfortable with our investments there.
John Case: It’s a combination of portfolios as well as one-off transactions, Spenser. So, year-to-date, more than 80% of our acquisitions have been large -- larger negotiated [ph] sale leaseback transactions where we were the only company [ph] in negotiations with those tenants. And what we found is we’re seeing a market that’s really different than the broader sector. [Technical difficulty] because of our access to capital and cost of capital we’re able to execute very large sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiation basis which allow us -- which enable us really to diversify. So, a lot of companies in the sector can’t [technical difficulty]. So, some of the growth is coming from that activity and some of its continued one-off smaller portfolios, given a [technical difficulty] net lease acquisitions market.
John Case: The industrial asset, [technical difficulty] really one large asset, a distribution center in Northern California that [technical difficulty]development take out and on development properties we get yields that are anywhere from the 100 to 150 basis points higher than where we get them on a stabilized basis. So, this particular -- on the industrial side our cap rates because it was the development property were actually higher than 6.5%. And then on the retail side, they were just slightly under that, Nick.
John Case: The information that’s been coming in, sales from our tenants that report are continuing to improve. And that’s why you saw our coverage levels pick up a little bit from where they were in the previous quarter. So, the news on a tenant level is positive and we feel very good about [technical difficulty] really minimal percentage is outstanding on the watch list.
John Case: We’re pleased with the strength of the balance sheet today, debt to EBITDA at 5.5x. When we look forward, including the accordion, we have about $2 billion of capacity on the revolver. Our overall floating rate debt exposure [technical difficulty] right now. We also have [technical difficulty] we’re anticipating about $150 million in proceeds, asset sales, and we’re also anticipating probably about $75 million retained equity from our business in our operations to help fund our growth. Both, the bond -- really all the long-term capital markets are open to us right now, 10-year bond [technical difficulty] and right around four, three or so. So, that’s attractive. And as the appropriate [technical difficulty] all of our alternatives Karin with regard to financing the acquisitions.
John Case: Well, right now they are coming at attractive levels. So, I think the second quarter levels are pretty indicative of where [technical difficulty] this quarter, and we’re optimistic that spreads will continue to widen out a bit, so our margins will improve.
John Case: Well, we’ve on the industrial side had a strategy of being in significant markets where there’s good re-leasing opportunities if needed or in mission-critical locations. The markets that [technical difficulty] in right now, that’s a very attractive sector right now. And the valuations are quite attractive. But, we’re not seeing any huge speculative supply issues in any of those markets. So, what is being built by the developers out there is being leased typically, if it’s not already pre-leased, leased during the construction phase. And by the time it’s completed, it’s leased. So, you we’re not looking to exit any specific markets on the industrial side, Brian.
John Case: So, on the development side, it’s always been an attractive way for us to grow. So, we have $25 million under development today. As I said, the yields are more attractive on development than they are on acquisitions. So, we remain bullish on -- we’d like to have more underdevelopment, decent amount of development spend second quarter, but we’re looking to put more development on the books forward. Now to remind everyone, all the development is preleased. We don’t do speculative development and [technical difficulty] existing clients. So, certainly a low-risk form of development.
John Case: [Technical difficulty] so that $2.6 million payment in insurance proceeds on one asset, an asset that was destroyed by a tornado and that showed up in our other income area. 
John Case: All right. Well, thanks everybody for joining us today. And we look forward to seeing you this fall in conferences and marketing meetings. So, I hope everybody has a good summer and thanks again for joining us.
