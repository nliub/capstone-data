Mike Lamach: Thanks Steve and please go to slide 18, our forecast for 2010 is based on mix but improving markets. We continue to expect slow recovery in the U.S. and Europe growth in Asia and mixed activity levels in our major vertical end markets. A recent order rates indicate that we are seeing signs of recovery in refrigeration, industrial, club car, residential HVAC and security as well as commercial HVAC parts contracting and service. We also expect to see a continuation of the challenging conditions from the U.S. non-residential construction market for the balance of the year. We are certainly encouraged by our orders in backlog and economy turns can be choppy and so we believe the best approach is to be conservative in our market outlooks and continue to relentlessly focus on achieving our productivity targets offsetting material inflation through higher price utilization and continued investment in our long term growth through innovation. Please to go slide 19. Based on this mixed but improving view of the world, we are raising the lower end of our revenue range by 1 percentage point, now expect revenues for full year 2000 and will be up 3% to 5% compared with 2009. We expect Industrial to show gains in the mid single digit range and residential to show gains in the upper single digit range. Climate control revenues are expected to be up slightly with declines in HVAC equipment and gains in both refrigeration and contracting parts and service. Security is expected to show a year-over-year decline due to its exposure of non-residential building, especially in North America. This results in a 3% to 5% full year growth for total Ingersoll-Rand. Second quarter revenues will be bit stronger than we previously expected and we continue working our programs to increase full year revenues above our projected range. Please go to slide 20. As a result of an improving revenue outlook, we are now projecting full year 2010 EPS from continuing operations including restructuring and $0.12 of one time healthcare tax costs to be $1.88 to $2.23 per share with the lower end up $0.05 from last quarter's guidance. Including $0.10 of costs associated with discontinued operations, total EPS is projected to $1.78 to $2.13. Additionally our forecast is built following assumption. Our full year forecast assumes 1% price realization year-over-year, a tax rate of about 18%, $0.25 per share of restructuring and productivity investments and EPS based on a 341 million share count. Second quarter revenues are forecast to be in a range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion which is up approximately 3% to 6%, compared to the second quarter of 2009. EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in a range of $0.62 to $0.72 including $0.05 of restructuring and productivity investments. To sum up the forecast for 2010 we expect 2010 to demonstrate our focus on driving top tier operational performance across each of our businesses while steadily increasing the delivery of customer focused innovation in products, systems, services and business models. We expect to see modest revenue growth and significant earnings growth as we continue to deliver on these objectives.\ And now, Steve and I will be happy to take your questions.
Mike Lamach: Yes, I think that we have a couple of small unfavorable discreet items in the first quarter. The PVT is, as well as it is, even a few bucks causes the rate to do weird things. So that's what happened in the first quarter. We still feel pretty good about 18% for the year.
Mike Lamach: For 2010, we're looking at probably growth 3% to 4% in overall revenues and I would think that's sort of based, we're looking at operating margins probably in the 7.5% to 8% range. For the out years we're really not going to go there but I can tell you that, for each of the business we do continue to on the restructuring programs. Across the company we're really looking to try to get 2 points of net margin improvement over the couple of years, all right next few years.
Mike Lamach: Absolutely, Jeff, we are looking really at this thing over multiple phases over multiple years. The plan that we got laid out here just as Steve had said. We talked a lot about the manufacturing cost structure but we will tell you that, we are looking at the cost structure of the entire company in a similar way. So, again as you look at all of the in terms of productivity as we see it we think about productivity against the fuller cost base of the company and how we are measuring it. So, then again we will see in state to been try to just sequentially march up a couple of points of operating margin each year in a very consistent basis.
Mike Lamach: I will start by saying we have put in place, we have talked about it in the last quarter a very programmatic approach to, if you call it top line margin expansion which is not just pricing but pricing management across the company. Every sector is engaged, every business is engaged we have got demonstration projects set up across the company to do this and so there is a very programmatic approach to what we are taking. Now, that being said, we have had sectors that have been able to initiate actual price increases under the market place the list prices. So the combination of list price management where we can do that and price management, in areas like sort of rebating gross from that distribution of how we look at discounting across various dealers are all its process and as we said last time a lot of that tends to be back end loaded to the nature of just studying this programs up which is pretty well timed to our expectation for inflation of the back half of the year as well.
Mike Lamach: Yes, I think Nigel that we were disappointed frankly in the revenue for the quarter. It was $100 million less the midpoint and it was frustrating to all of us watching bookings grow, backlogs grow and customer shipment requests and requirements moving past the quarter. So we knew we had the book of business, we knew we had the capacity we were constrained somewhat with what we were able to do with that. We also saw, what I would classify as the burn rate of our contracting business to be a bit slower than we anticipate at the size of the backlog, sort of the size of the contact and projects are so large now in the backlog that in some cases, customers have to weigh their own schedules to coordinate activity across multiple trades. So I would tell you that really the bulk of the mess came out of what would be the train commercial business and I would say half related to your contracting and half related to equipment shipments. The plants particularly applied were extremely busy. We had a record â€“ shipments record bookings actually in China, bookings up over 30%. The factory was really humming there, with chiller productions, those are great sign. But it was certainly a timing issue and as we got through the backlog and got through all the operating reviews this quarter and with the teams we will get clarity about what the nature of the backlog is and we feel about Q2-Q3, sort of seeing that come through. If you have a focus on productivity, it's something that we just have to do and great companies have got the balance to look at productivity versus innovation and growth and obviously last year I think every company was hyper focused on productivity and getting their variable costs right and reducing their fixed costs. We were no different. That I think had added urgency around debt reduction. Since we've put a lot of investment and communication around innovation in the marketplace and when most people get out in the marketplace they sense that there is something happening inside these businesses around new product development launches. So there is a lot of momentum with the distribution base, with the employee base and I would even say that the competitors have taken notice of some of the launches in play. So we've got to balance it Nigel and I always would worry that we can't went up too far than the other and then trick for us is going to be to make sure we keep it in perspective. Nigel there is one other issue that you should consider. I made a comment in the prepared remarks. We really did not see any up lift associated with stocking in our channels, even our Res HVAC business or securities businesses and that's where we lost lot of ground last year with the de-stocking in the first quarter. So, there is a structural thing going on in here too in addition to what Mike just talked about which, now we believe the end markets as we said in the RES HVAC world we are growing single digits. Okay so we believe that we are seeing the pull through but we expect that to pick up throughout the year. So, that was another structural thing alone in the first quarter.
Mike Lamach: To give you a little more color on that Nigel we saw actually commercial security residential security and residential HVAC actually have lower inventory levels and part of that I give you the good example on the residential HVAC business, our cycle times are five to seven days. Lead times distributors have historically been for us 21 day. So, there hasn't been as much of need for a distributor to take the sack in position that they would have knowing they are going to be filled in a fairly short period of time. So in some ways, some of the operating improvements of cycle time I think as compounded the fact that you are not seeing that the inventory build back.
Mike Lamach: Yes, the sell-through though Nigel has been like 2%, 3% so stocking to a AHRIs Steve Eric last week at a meeting and you were commenting about the quarter sell through bidding 2%. Those things and some of the other releases yesterday again have trend 2% to 3% of sell through. You see a lot of your 20 key load in, you see some changes where the business model is changed from company owned to distribution and there is sore of kind of folding distribution changing the nature of from the balance sheet to the income statement and I think that caused for quite a few non-lease in the first quarter but the sell through I believe when you check it will be around 2%, 3%.
Mike Lamach: Well, March has been the exciting, just a bit more color. The industry is kind of adopted historical practice of doing a place discounts for the seasonal load in. We didn't do that and toward the end of March when it become clearly we weren't going to do that, we got very late orders in March that have continued all the way through till now in April, well distributors realize that they need to carry 21 days of inventory going forward. So, we didn't any specify pricing mechanism this time around and hopefully that will change this ongoing forward. Certainly for us but across the industry as well.
Mike Lamach: Well, you got to also remember you got a pretty big element of residential security here that is going to impact our forecast for Q2 and you have got some new products well a lots has been happened in Q2 which help support a bit of our forecast but in terms of the fundamentals industry we believe there is going to be kind of a mid-single digit higher single digit HVAC market they are performing. We are helped by through the residential locking and security portfolio, due launched electronic locks, communicating locks and load-ins from another product we will be introducing in Q2. We will talk about that next quarter that how those maybe deal a little bit better than that.
Mike Lamach: Financially, Bob, your right. We would love it and get it done it. But it gets down to execution and the ability to really manage the pitching and receiving end of all that we're doing. So what looks like seven closures on the surface is probably more than 35 projects being implemented in the quarter at various levels. So it gets down to really the amount of risk you can take and the movement of the product, the pace of execution across those products and that's the pacing item for us in all companies is protecting the customer and handling it right at both ends.
Mike Lamach: ...dramatically different organization which is now in place. We got in place since really December being added to with dedicated program and project managers coming from very, very big operational backgrounds, either our company or outside of our company, kind of in a central organization, working with each of the business that helps really keep track of the stuff. So it's been working pretty well. Part of it is just as we got that team involved literally we were able to pick up a few million dollars in the quarter and just cost reduction moves. So the $14 million under spend there, largely a good portion of that was just due to better execution of the moves we planned.
Mike Lamach: Well, I think it is sort of in the process of dropping. I'd like to see it through Q3 because before I state beyond that. If you look at our central billings and look at the typical lag you get of 10 to 12 months, particularly on unitary which tends to be a bit more speculative and often in terms of its look, it's spilt by developers and commercial, private construction companies and investors. You love to see that through Q3 before you really call bottom on that? But I think it feels like its dropping.
Mike Lamach: We try to manage long lead deliveries with escalators that come into play on various commodities if you trigger a point that changes the invoice that applies to the customer. But there is a lag between sort of what's in the backlog and what comes out in the areas of unitary or HVAC for our security business which uses quite a bit of non-ferrous. We're able to price them fairly quickly because the cycle times are much shorter for both projects and orders.
Mike Lamach: Hey, Bob, one of the â€“ to your first question, if it helps okay. Backlog was up about 14% in the first quarter and as the end of December to the end of March. Our backlogs went up 14% and that was over â€“ so that's over 1.0 book-to-bill across all of our businesses.
Mike Lamach: Yes. I'll do the first part and let Steve talk to you a bit more about the currency but a nice surprise in industrial technology to end the quarter. We have bookings up 20%. As we look out in the second quarter we see a similar trend continuing. Climate solutions bookings were up 11%. The nature of the industrial bookings would not lend itself toward all second quarter. It's going to tend to be a larger machine that will pop down Q2, Q3 and Q4. So you'll see that kind of balancing out over maybe three quarters.\ Climate solutions I think it will happen a bit quicker. The areas we saw transport across the world with significant bookings up in the high 30s that tends to be quicker shift perhaps in the quarter. The other big surprise for us was with climate solutions in Asia. We localized chiller production there last year. We have had great success with filling up that capacity and really hitting the market seeing great demand and sell through. That will tend to be Q2 through Q4 much like the big air product will be. So, I look at it as coming through in Q2. We felt confident enough to take sort of a Q2 guidance up a little bit based on the backlog that certainly is not going to all spill through in Q2.
Mike Lamach: Let me give you.Jeffrey Hammond â€“ KeyBanc Capital Markets: And then, why are you looking for that, just can you comment on stimulus you didn't mention it all I think one of your competitors out today kind of saying hey it's starting to come through.
Mike Lamach: In China, I mean I would say probably well more than our fair share presence so that's been a good time but to U.S. is not something that's passing in our reviews, its being some sort of a windfall or accounting on a so significant way.Jeffrey Hammond â€“ KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Mike Lamach: Hey, Jeff, on your other question, it's about the impact of the currency is about $10 million unfavorable between previous guidance and current.Jeffrey Hammond â€“ KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thanks.
Mike Lamach: I would say from the guidance we gave you Steve, if you looked at the $100 billion missed at the midpoint more than a 100 of it would have come from the TCS organization and that is going to be levered at very substantial rate. So, that will give you a little bit of insight that the whole math could be explained right there.
Mike Lamach: I can give you sort of orders looking at China would have been up north of 30%, okay? And that's largely going to be applied; the unitary business there is fairly small.
Mike Lamach: It's a high leveraged business I wouldn't say it's the highest I mean security technology is going to be very high.
Mike Lamach: I think inflation was lighter than we thought in the first quarter and its going to come back I think at the back half of the year. So we probably over-clubbed it in quarter one and I think we got it for the full year is pretty close to what we had when we gave guidance.
Mike Lamach: Well, yes, we talked about security, the res solutions business. Again I want to make sure you guys realize that the security business had a pretty big impact in that. We're starting to see big swings at builder and big box as well as new product launches around electronics and that is another major factor for us in total. So that's what's actually probably pulling up the total more than the HVAC number being higher than the industry.
Mike Lamach: Yes, I'd say climate operating margins Q2 are probably down to 9% â€“ 9% full year, 7.5% to 8%. Industrial Q2 margins are probably 11% to 11.5%, full year probably 10.5% to 11%. Res margins are â€“ they're probably going to be 9% â€“ 9.5% in Q2 and probably around 9.5% for the full year. Security, pretty stable with margins in the quarter of roughly 20% for Q2 and for the year roughly 20%.
Mike Lamach: If you look at anything Mark, kind of cut quarter-to-quarter like this, it's changing mixes in the business. The Asia business spiking as fast as it did relative to U.S. business, changes in mix would have been a bit of a surprise for us. Probably, if you look at commodity cost coming back in and longer lead pricing that we've done with the backlog, that's the one area that you're going to get caught, sort of upside down for a period of time. It's going to tend to be on the climate side, particularly in the applied side. So that's a subtle reasons for that but nothing sort of fundamental and structural about any major disappointments that we're seeing. Security has done some recent things around pricing, put in place a price increase that will take us back to the second quarter, pretty typical there for them to do that and they've had some favorability in steel prices for the first quarter, pretty aggressive on the top line margin expansion programs, probably more confident in security getting to the top end of the ranges. In tough markets security technology typically has had pretty high margins and they kind of buckle it down, tighten it up and that's what's we're seeing here.
Mike Lamach: Yes, Mark, we're going to write a spec on that business, we're going to give a budget quote, we're going to give a quote and the shipment of the product could be anywhere from three months to a year. And so you run the potential â€“ unless you can index some of your costs to metals in the contact, you're going to run a risk that on some you're not going to be able to recover a upside down situation. The flipside of that, if you see it the other way, you're probably going to make a little bit of an extra margin to go the other way.
Mike Lamach: I can't give it to you off my head; we look at it collectively. We try to get everybody in the game run innovation So, I would probably tell you that it would be higher to proportion these products because all what worth we did in the Trane portfolio of last year and this year. We have also got a ton of it happening in the ITS business well the compressor renewals and platforms and tools that they are doing. So, my best guess it might be 80% product related.Robert McCarthy â€“ Robert W. Baird: Okay so if that's the case as we proceed into cyclical recovery does that mean that â€“ because the products will grow faster than service all else equal than this number should also continue to grow as it did this past year from 15 to 18.
Mike Lamach: Absolutely. I mean, we are driving a hell out of this, I would like to see this getting to 25% in three years I mean we have had that goal saved internally. This gets to Nigel's question are you balancing productivity and growth. The answer is it's a high speed both ways, both gears trying to push hard as we can in the way we are measuring this up and investments and also penetration. We have follow a program launch even after its launch to see did we get the penetration we thought, did we get the margin we thought we would get so. There is rigger inside the company around there is much like you would see through productivity.Robert McCarthy â€“ Robert W. Baird: Thank you, that's helpful. And then, the other thing I want to ask about is not beat it dead for us and I have realized we have covered a lot of the ground related to Trane Commercial. I wanted to try and distillate it in a different way, bookings up 4% in climate solutions in the first quarter. Total year forecast of 2 to 4, so expect the comparison at TCS to get worse as we proceed through the year offsetting strong comps in the other business as we proceed or are we just saying that we don't have a lot of conviction that a positive bookings comparison could be sustain period.
Mike Lamach: Fundamentally, I'm just trying to give you guidance with the range that's going to embed risk on one end and potential upside on the other but what we're attempting to do here and perhaps we're going to get better at this is really staring into the guidance that we've got for these businesses. So the guidance we're laying out there for Q2 would have the Climate Solutions business at mid-point growing at about 4%. We've been looking for about 200 basis points of margin expansion. That's how we see it. Really not trying to be too conservative or too optimistic. We're trying to be realistic here.Robert McCarthy â€“ Robert W. Baird: And you've been very transparent. So thank you for that.
Mike Lamach: No, we believe we continue to take some share. The uptick at Hussmann is really focused on some of the large national accounts that are going through significant remodeling activity and the business is flowing through as we expected and not really any concerns there.
Mike Lamach: I would just add that we believe that looking at the industrial orders, if there was any upside in terms of our expectations, it was there. So that was all pretty good.
Steve Shawley: You're talking about those should beâ€¦?David Raso â€“ International Strategy and Investment Group: 2010 to 2011. I assume it's with North American profits but just trying to understand being domicile in Ireland, I think through such a jump year-over-year.
Steve Shawley: This time the collections has come up for at least the last two years. We expect to see 25% levels at sort of peak cycle performance. So it's not unusual.David Raso â€“ International Strategy and Investment Group: All right, appreciate it. Thank you.
Steve Shawley: I think you will see it better forecast from us going forward in that area. Again that's one of the areas we are looking back that's probably one we had some control over and then the guidance we gave.Andy Casey â€“ Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. So tying all that back to the margin in Climate Solutions, there's a lot going on in the quarter but as you said, you should get better leverage on some of the HVAC products specific stuff, better contract burn, forecast at minimum and then should we expect to see the leverage from Thermo King really start to impact that line Q2 and beyond.
Steve Shawley: The last Q2 was an operating margin of 7.3%. We take on 4% growth and look at the productivity that we've got built into the business and again you look for something around, margin expansions in that business. We think we can keep that up.Andy Casey â€“ Wells Fargo Securities: Okay, thank you.
Steve Shawley: This projection is built on a â‚¬135 and actually when we put together the guidance several months ago for the first quarter in the year at that point in time we were looking at about a 140, 141. So, we got the FX built in.Jeffrey Hammond â€“ KeyBanc Capital Markets: So, how much revenue did you lose on FX either percentage or absolute basis as you swing the FX.
Steve Shawley: I would say that we are still seeing pressures from metals like everybody at this point in time but within a bandwidth of some of the guidance I gave last time.
Steve Shawley: In our previous guidance and the euro is the impact of our revenue, okay? So as the euro goes, goes our revenue got calculations. So, in our original guidance we read about a buck 41 and our current projection, our current forecast is based on a buck 35 that's about a 3.6% delta.
Steve Shawley: Well, in our previous report, there is about a two point impact and it is probably somewhere in the same range.
Steve Shawley: Well, I hear there might be as many as 160,000 units that are in the channel. So that's going to take a while to come through and I would imagine it will be bleeding out of the system through June, which June, July even through the season.
Steve Shawley: I think where we targeted the refreshes we've targeted the investment around tier levels. We've seen share pick up. We've seen good margin performance, in the areas where the product is older and dated, where we've got product launching this summer and fall, yes, it's a little bit tougher and it's been a bit more competitive from a pricing perspective but all in all its behaving about the way you expect with the exception of a lot more 22 being stuffed than you would have originally thought.
Steve Shawley: We saw really good trends across all of the businesses but clearly a big difference between security technologies which would have had bookings in the quarter of one point versus Industrial where you'd have seen 20 points of bookings growth. So good sequential pickup cost but varying widely between where they are in the cycle.
Steve Shawley: Yes, Marty. If you look at just the math at the operating income level, roughly $700 million of additional revenue had about a 32% leverage okay. So it's very much within our targeted leverage, incremental leverage performance that we're looking for.Marty Pollack â€“ NWQ Investment Management: And that would be, would you see that incremental leverage continue at sort of that 30% rate or do we see even further acceleration to third quarter? I think third quarter is also strong usually and fourth quarter maybe backs off a bit.
Steve Shawley: Yes, I would say the leverage in the third quarter will be stronger and Mike alluded to that earlier because that's usually when our service businesses are most active and you see good margins out of there. So it's slightly stronger but not outlandish. Soâ€¦Marty Pollack â€“ NWQ Investment Management: Okay, thanks so much.
Bob Cornell â€“ Barclays Capital: A couple of questions. You put the order growth up 10% but could you structure that in terms of book-to-bill for mainly the orders because they're all over the place. Book-to-bill would help.
Bob Cornell â€“ Barclays Capital: A philosophical question to expand on some of the questions that have been answered already. On this program of capacity optimization, I get the opportunity and the upside but I wonder what's the gating factor in terms of how much is spent. Given the magnitude of the opportunity, you think maybe it'd be spending more now. I see the ramp to $56 million but how do you define that opportunity and the rate of spend versus the size of the opportunity.
Bob Cornell â€“ Barclays Capital: Get it. Final question. No one asked this and it's a tough question. On the unitary train business, where do you guys see that business bottoming? That's part one of that question.
Mark Koznarek â€“ Cleveland Research: A few comments on margin expectations have been tossed out there. I'm wondering if you could just step through the segments just to make sure that we've got them along the lines of the review that you gave last conference call.
Mark Koznarek â€“ Cleveland Research: Just a clarification, Mike, on that climate applied comment, with regard to it. It sounded like you were saying, price might lag cost but I was under the impression on the applied side since there really isn't a price list every project has to be specked and negotiated individually. I thought you could respond to price â€“ respond to raw material signals right away in that business, unlike, say, the residential part of HVAC.
Mark Koznarek â€“ Cleveland Research: So, it's actually up like a point more than you're stating here in the way you guys state your guidance. Your cores are actually up perhaps half a point or a point.
