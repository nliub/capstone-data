Anurag Maheshwari: Thank you, Judy. Starting with Q2 segment sales performance on Slide 6. Total organic sales were down 1% in the quarter, driven by new equipment, which was down 9% compared to the prior year. APAC grew approximately 10%, driven by strong performances in Southeast Asia and India, while the Americas grew low-single digits. EMEA experienced a low-single digit decline due to continued weakness in Central Europe, while China declined double-digits, largely due to the deterioration in market conditions. New Equipment pricing was strong outside of China, up low to mid-single digits. China remains under intense price pressure. And although pricing in China was down year-over-year, it came in approximately flat sequentially, while the cost environment remains deflationary. Service sales were $2.2 billion with organic sales growth of 5.1%, marking over three years of mid-single digit or greater growth in every quarter. We grew in all regions and all lines of business, including approximately 5% in maintenance and repair as a result of strong portfolio growth, solid repair volumes and maintenance pricing, which was up 3.5 points excluding the impact of mix and churn. Driven by continued double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, MOD organic sales increased about 6% in the quarter and 8% in the first half. Turning to Q2 segment operating performance on Slide 7. New Equipment operating profit of $110 million was down $6 million at constant currency, mainly due to the impacts of lower volume and mix headwinds. Pricing outside of China, productivity, including benefits from uplift and commodity tailwinds largely offset the volume and mix impacts netting to improved margins of 30 basis points to 7.7%, ahead of our expectation. Service operating profit of $538 million increased $51 million at constant currency as drop through on higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity, including benefits from uplift more than offset annual wage inflation. This led to margin expansion of 110 basis points in the quarter. Our focus on cost control, alongside the ramp of uplift initiatives drove lower SG&A absolute dollars, while improving our adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales by 30 basis points year-over-year. For the first half, despite an inflationary environment, our SG&A dollars reduced by approximately $30 million and improved by 30 basis points as a percent of sales. We are very pleased with our progress and uplift across the three levers we've outlined with benefits ramping quicker than anticipated. Our streamlined functional structure is yielding productivity benefits while allowing us to leverage our global scale to drive cost savings, especially with our digital technology operations and other indirect spend. With solid Service performance and while navigating a challenging New Equipment environment, we expanded overall operating profit margins by 110 basis points and grew adjusted EPS $0.14 or 15%. Shifting to cash. Despite lower New Equipment orders, we generated $353 million of free cash flow in the second quarter and we expect to largely reverse the working capital build by year end. Overall, we had a very strong first half performance overcoming weakness in the China market. We grew organic sales 1.2%, led by performance in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, which were up mid-single digits as well as strength in our Service segment. This growth in conjunction with good traction on uplift, productivity, pricing and commodity tailwinds helped us expand margins by 100 basis points and grow EPS 13% positioning us well for the second half. Let me now turn it back to Judy to discuss our 2024 outlook.
Anurag Maheshwari: Thank you, Judy. Taking a more detailed look at our outlook and starting with sales on Slide 10. We now expect total organic sales to be up 1% to 3%. Overall, New Equipment organic sales are now expected to be down mid-single digits from market driven decline in China, which we now expect to be down approximately 20%. The outlook for the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific remains unchanged, up mid-single digits combined. Service organic sales are anticipated to grow 6% to 7%, in line with prior guidance. This includes maintenance and repair within a range of 5.5% to 6.5% and for modernization, we anticipate growth of 8% to 9% and solid orders momentum and an expanding backlog provide good line of sight to achieve approximately 10% growth in the second half. Turning to Slide 11. At constant currency, operating profit should grow $160 million to $190 million, unchanged versus prior expectations with improving contributions from service and productivity, including Uplift offsetting New Equipment volume and mix headwinds. In Service, we now expect operating profit margin to expand approximately 75 basis points, an increase of 25 basis point versus the prior guide, driven by solid volumes and even better productivity. For New Equipment, despite the weakness in China, operating profit margin is expected to be roughly flat versus the prior year, a change versus our prior estimate of flat to up 10 basis points. Productivity and pricing are offsetting the added volume and mix impact from a weaker China outlook. We now expect overall adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 80 basis points as a result of Service volume, productivity and pricing tailwinds. This represents a 30 basis point improvement versus our prior outlook. Turning to cash flow. We expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with net income growth, partially offset by changes in working capital. Moving to the 2024 EPS bridge on Slide 12. We have raised the low end of our outlook for adjusted EPS by $0.02 to a range of $3.85 to $3.90. At the midpoint, this is $0.34 of EPS growth versus the prior year, driven by operational performance. At constant currency, we expect approximately $0.32 of operating profit growth, level loaded between the first and the second half. Reductions in the effective tax rate and the lower share count more than offset headwinds from higher interest expense and ForEx. In closing, first half results demonstrate our ability to continue performing despite macro headwinds. There is a lot in our control in the second half, and we are focused on growing our portfolio, leveraging our expanding MOD backlog while ramping on the Uplift program and driving productivity throughout the organization. This sets us up well to achieve our full year outlook of approximately 10% EPS growth in line with our medium term guide. With that, Sarah, please open the line for questions.
Anurag Maheshwari: There is more to come here. We’re focused on closing the earnings call right now and a smooth transition with Cristina. Thanks for the question, Jeff.
Anurag Maheshwari: Yeah. Thanks, Judy. So Nigel, if you look at the new equipment market in China, it is clearly challenging. And the revenue in the second quarter was down as well double-digit, as we said. Okay. The reason you don't see on the NCI line is because we're able to manage the volume headwind through productivity through growing our Service business. And it's not only all across all the other regions, it's also in China as well. So we do what we can control. So from a margin perspective and a profit perspective, we've been able to preserve it.
Anurag Maheshwari: Yeah. Thanks. I think you got it pretty much, but let me give a little bit more color, right? In the first half, we built about $300 million of working capital and primarily due to two reasons. The first reason what you mentioned, New Equipment orders, we typically receive down payments and that auto environment has obviously been challenging for the first half. The second, which I think is the largest driver is that the Service business grew faster than the New Equipment business, and we tend to be cash ahead of New Equipment while we collect in Service after we perform the work. These two other drivers, which got us to build $300 million of working capital. So for the back half of the year, we expect to generate about $825 (ph) million in GAAP net income. And if we reverse about $200 million or more in working capital, that will get us closer to the $1.6 billion. We, of course, will look to do better like the same way as we did in the second half of last year and especially on receivables and in the New Equipment orders do a little bit better than expected then this could be a source of upside, and we could get us to about $1.6 billion of free cash.
Anurag Maheshwari: So I'll just start off with the first half, second half, and Cristina can give more color on Q3 as well. So we've done about $1.94 of EPS in the first half and a midpoint of the guidance $3.88, so which implies another $1.94 in the second half, right? So from an operational perspective, it's equal between the first half and the second half. Cristina, give a little bit more color on Q3.
Anurag Maheshwari: Yeah. Thanks. So as Judy mentioned, right, so one of the biggest drivers for us is going to be on the margin side, volume for sure on Service. If you look at the market over the past three years, it's been down. But the reason our portfolio grew is because of conversion rates improving. And there's still more to come on the conversion rates as it goes around. So I think we feel fairly confident on the volume growth over there. On the cost side, clearly, the earlier question that Nigel asked as well, the reason why the NCI was where it was is because of the how we able to maintain our profitability is looking at our cost base. One is we are fortunate in China to be in a deflationary economy in terms of supply chain, so that helps us. But also, we've looked at the footprint that we have, both in terms of the branches in terms of facilities, and we'll continue to take a look at it to kind of bring the cost down. So we feel a combination of volume and productivity. And on the cost side, will help us keep the margins or maybe expand the margins going forward.
Anurag Maheshwari: Yeah. The only thing I -- just one thing, if I could just add to that, is if you look at, it’s a comp from last year, where the second quarter was the highest in terms of repair growth. Repair, as Judy has mentioned is still growing at very good high-single digit, if not double-digit in the back half of the year.
Anurag Maheshwari: Thanks for the question. So firstly, just to ground everyone, China New Equipment is our largest margin region in Otis. So it's actually, when China volume goes down, it's a mixed headwind for us. It's not a mix tailwind for us, where team was able to offset the mix which is quite substantial for the quarter because if you look at a revenue down a couple of hundred million dollars and that to essentially in China on the New Equipment side, and that causes about a $40 million, $50 million headwind. We were able to offset that because of pricing in our backlog from the other regions, which was positive, commodities, productivity and the benefits of uplift. So we control what we can control. And as we've gone through this call, China is an important New Equipment market. We all appreciate that. But I think the other regions plus productivity have been more than able to offset that as a result of what you saw the margin expansion.
Anurag Maheshwari: Yeah. The portfolio growth 4.2% consistent in previous quarters. The pricing 3.5%, adjusting from -- without mix and churn, that's also pretty consistent. The reason it's a little bit on a relative level at 4.9% slower growth is because of the comp from the previous year, driven by repair business. So if you look at -- as we go into the second half, portfolio will continue to grow at 4% plus, pricing looks good, repair should be back to high-single digit, double-digit and a combination of that will get us towards the 6.5%, 7%.
Judith Marks: Now on Slide 8. Before turning to our updated 2024 financial outlook, let me briefly update you on our industry outlook. For the New Equipment market, our expectations for the Americas and EMEA remain unchanged, down low-single digit in units. We now expect Asia to be down high-single digits in units versus the prior outlook of down mid-single digits, driven by weakness in China. There is no change to our outlook for Asia Pacific as the region has continued to perform well. We're revising China to be down 10% to down 15% as activity is weaker than we previously expected. While New Equipment markets remain under pressure, we continue to see strength in the service market, with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA, and mid-single digit growth in Asia. The global installed base is expected to grow mid-single digits in 2024, adding roughly 1 million units from units that were installed within the last two years and are now rolling off the warranty period. Turning to Otis' 2024 financial outlook. We now expect sales in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.5 billion, with organic sales growth of 1% to 3%. While we see continued strength in the Service business for the remainder of the year, this decrease in organic sales versus our prior outlook is driven by New Equipment, which Anurag will discuss in a moment. Adjusted operating profit is in line with prior expectations still expected to be up $135 million to $175 million at actual currency and up $160 million to $190 million at constant currency. Adjusted EPS is now expected in the range of $3.85 to $3.90, up 9% to 10%, with $0.02 improvement versus the low end of the prior guide, driven by strong operational performance and the benefit from a lower share count. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to come within a range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. Before handing it back to Anurag to outline the 2024 segment outlook in more detail, let me turn to Slide 9 to provide an update on Project Uplift and our progress to-date. We now anticipate run rate savings of $175 million by mid-2025, as we have made solid progress executing on the program. Two areas where we're seeing additional benefit versus our prior expectations are through further streamlining of our global operating model, and incremental optimization of indirect spend in areas such as digital technology and infrastructure. As we exit 2024, our anticipated in-year savings are now slated to be approximately $60 million with a 2024 exit run rate of approximately $100 million. Overall, program is on track, we're performing well versus our internal benchmarks and time line, and we look forward to sharing additional updates with you in the coming quarters. Anurag, over to you.
Judith Marks: Yeah. Thanks, Jeff, and great to be with you this morning. Our Service business in China, specifically, units are up high-teens for another quarter. MOD orders are up high-single digit. MOD sales are up double-digit. And we're really pleased with the pivot we've made. And now this is now a multiyear strategy we've been implementing to have a greater focus and yield in China on Service. Almost a third of our revenue now in China is in Service, and that's twice what it was when we spun. Our portfolio has more than doubled and is up again this quarter, as I said, high-teens. So our service strategy is coming up nicely, and we're seeing the acceleration of MOD in China and anticipate that to continue to move double-digit as we look out into the medium term for China. The New Equipment market does remain weak. We called it down 15% for the second quarter after being down 10% in the first quarter. But with what we know on the ground from Sally and the team for the full year, we're saying it's going to be down 10% to 15%. Our team has done a really nice job in being able to manage the cost side in a very competitive market, but that market this year, we're saying for China is going to be between 425,000 and 450,000 units. Again, focused on growing Service, continuing to drive out cost in a deflationary environment, but always balancing price and volume so that we make sure that our backlog remains healthy in China. 425,000 to 450,000 units is still a very nicely sized market, but this is the third year of decreases. And I think our strategy and implementation has pivoted to service to be able to reflect that. It's why we took our guide down in terms of top line revenue now to be organic, 1% to 3%, that is all driven by this New Equipment decline there. But as you could see with our profitability this quarter for the first half, even our profit margin expansion in New Equipment, despite being down several hundred million dollars of revenue, you're seeing the resilience in not just our service driven model, but I think you're seeing again, sustained quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year performance in those items that we control.
Judith Marks: Yeah. Let me take the first one, and I'll turn it over to Anurag, although, we're kind of fighting over the second one because we both want to answer it. So Nigel, it's no change in strategy. What you're probably not seeing behind the scenes is, how our team has, again, continued to pivot. We continue to do product introductions and we continue to drive delivery in terms of our orders through our agents and distributors. Our agents and distributors, again, think about 2,400 of them. A lot of them have also taken on modernization as well. So we've expanded their remit, so that we continue to prepare for the future, which is going to be a more MOD heavy future regardless of what happens structurally on the new equipment side. So the strategies, it's on track. We know what we're doing there. We talk about -- we've had significant China share gains since spin, but we're not going to take on loss making units for the sake of share gain, and that's something I've been telling you now quarter-after-quarter and we're going to be consistent with that methodology versus giving up price and then having that negative piece in the backlog. We just don't think that's -- we don't need that for our business, and we don't think it's wise. But Anurag let me -- let you touch on the second half.
Judith Marks: Yeah. The last thing I'll add on NCI is our Middle East business has picked up at a very good pace. It's one of several highlights for EMEA, and you see EMEA orders are up, EMEA is strong in revenue, and EMEA is a large modernization opportunity for us, including the Middle East. Outside of China, the majority of our remaining NCI is in the Middle East, Nigel.
Judith Marks: Sure, Julian. I think it's a great question and very, very -- it's the right analysis. Let me first give you an overview of New Equipment backlog around the globe, and then let me specifically dive into the Americas. We were down 3% and our 12 month rolling New Equipment orders are obviously down 7.7%. The Americas backlog though is up low-single digit. EMEA is up low-single digit. Asia-Pac is up mid-teens and China is down, obviously, which is driving Asia down for the broader picture. Our New Equipment outlook right now is to exit 2024 at the company level, flattish to slightly down as we expect backlog could fall in the second half, but it's really going to get defined by the New Equipment second half orders. And our line of sight to second half orders looks strong, especially in the Americas and some other regions. And let me just tell you, we have about an 18 month line of sight to the Americas, the majority of it being North America in terms of performing our backlog. And as I said, the Americas backlog is up low-single digit. The New Equipment sales in the Americas came in as expected in the second quarter low-single digit year-on-year comps as well as major projects. We anticipate that picking up in the second half. We also anticipate the New Equipment orders in the second half for the Americas to be positive. We can see that based on proposal activity. We can see that based on awards we have that haven't yet been booked and we believe you'll see that starting to come through in the third quarter.
Judith Marks: Yeah. And Julian, let me just correct myself quickly. The backlog total ex-China is up low-single digit, but the Americas backlog is down.
Judith Marks: Yeah, Joe. Listen, we added Modern -- delivering Modernization value as a fifth strategic imperative last year to really mobilize the company to industrialize how we're doing MOD and to take us from a position that you know where MOD margins were below new equipment to a place where not only would they meet new equipment margins but exceed them. We did that last quarter and first quarter. We've repeated that this quarter with our medium-term guide to get MOD margins up to at least double-digit and 10% as a starting point. We are on that trajectory. I'm pleased with that progress. The orders for MOD are continued to do well. Our company is responding very well. We're putting together the right kits to meet the customer needs as the demand signal is growing significantly. What we need to do is take those orders and that backlog, which is up 17%, and the orders were up 13.8% with growth in all regions. And we need to -- while we're continuing to grow orders, we need to grow our conversion to sales in Modernization. And we need to pick up that pace with installers. We need to pick up that pace with the kits now being supplied from our new industrialized processes. It's early days there, but you're going to continue to see that. So margins heading in the right direction on the trajectory we had shared, and we continue to see the MOD strategy is intact, and you're going to continue to see significant Modernization growth quarter-after-quarter, and I believe, year-after-year as we go through in the medium term and beyond.
Judith Marks: Yeah. So again, it's been three straight years. We peaked at about 650,000 units a year, and now we're guiding to 425,000 to 450,000 for this year, which is a pretty significant drop and yet if you look at our team's profitability across these three years and the return from our China team, I couldn't be more proud of how they've taken cost out, they're continuing to look at areas, uplift, structural facilities, branch structure, organization as Anurag alluded to. So we've dealt with that well while simultaneously growing our Service business. So you're going to see more and more service there over time. Listen, I can't and won't call a bottom. I don't know what that is. The Chinese government has put into play many simultaneous activities to try to stimulate both local government financing as recent as the third plenary as well as the PBOC reduced rates this week. There are multiple activities. To date, we have not seen that change consumer sentiment or the buying sentiment in properties yet. There is still a demand for hundreds of millions of Chinese residents to move from rural to urban. So we don't believe that will change, that's the plan and the path that the Chinese government has been on now for two decades, and we believe that's going to continue. And we think we've got the right strategy, and we've sized the business and moved more to Service and Modernization to be able to handle that. I will share, Joe, we -- earlier this week, we actually hosted Premier Li at one of our facilities in TEDA (ph) in the Tianjin region. It was a proud moment for us to host the Premier. And what we focused on, as you can imagine, was beyond all of the automation we have and how Otis has been a part of China will be celebrating 40 years there this fall. We did focus on urban renewal and modernization and our ability to continue to drive energy-efficient solutions, especially as China modernizes. 10 million units in the installed base in China that are now aging and it’s going to create a significant modernization demand that we are preparing for, and I would tell you, we’re ready for now.
Judith Marks: Yeah. I mean one of the clear areas, Justin, is just literally aging equipment and obsolescence and demand. I mean, of the 20 million plus, 22 million units in the installed base, over 7 million are 20 plus years older and many of those 30 plus years older. The largest market for that right now is in EMEA, and we're excited with our offerings there. What makes us different now is, we're getting away from custom MOD and bespoke MOD and industrializing this. And when we introduced our Gen 3 product to the market a year or two ago, we did it with the vision that we would have that offering modular available across the globe, a connected offering that would not just fulfill New Equipment drives whether it’s Gen 360 in EMEA and now China, but Gen 3 globally that we could then also package as a modernization opportunity. So as we brought out these products, the beauty of it is, as we’re educating the New Equipment sales team, we’re educating the MOD sales team. And as our installation crews from New Equipment are more familiar with Gen 3, now they’re doing Gen 3 Mod. So we’re attacking every part of this while attacking the cost side because now we’re buying Gen 3 at scale from our sub-suppliers and the manufacturing elements we do ourselves, and all of it is coming together nicely, which is driving the margins. But from a sales standpoint, we’ve simplified it. We have these relationships with customers. Think about our service portfolio at 2.3 million units, just on our portfolio. We have relationships with these service customers every day. Those are our MOD customers. And when we go on portfolio most of that work we can talk about. We can help them capital plan. We can create if there’s obsolescence. We can be more – it can be more proactive than reactive and all of that is coming together at a time when the demand is growing. So we’re ready for this. And I think you’re seeing – I know you’re seeing those results in MOD and you’re going to continue to see them.
Judith Marks: Yeah. I think you somewhat answered it, Nick. We have been seeing double-digit repair business now for three years. Originally, it was the post-COVID snapback, but then we've just seen really healthy repair growth. We believe that growth is going to grow again in the second quarter -- second half of the year. So it's not lumpy, but on occasion, again, we've guided in the past that as maintenance grows, you should think of repair growth is one point higher than that. That would say as our portfolio grows 4% plus, repair should grow 5% plus. We've been exceeding 10% now for almost three years in repairs. So I think it's fair to think a little high-single digit more for the second half, and that's a fair expectation.
Judith Marks: Yeah, Jack. On your second question, the ISPs don't play in the New Equipment pricing. So we're not seeing any one -- any of the other OEMs from what we can see in the market operating any differently than we've seen them operate in the past. Let me give you some color, though, on EMEA and APAC because they deserve that color. It's been really nice to see in a challenging EMEA market, we're performing really well in terms of orders. Obviously, watching interest rates and everything going on there. But for the quarter, our Central Europe business performed well. Our Southern Europe business performed well, and our Middle East business has performed very well. France and U.K. were a little weaker, but the backlog is solid -- and there -- you've now seen, whether it's 12 months, last quarter, this quarter, our EMEA team is doing a really nice job, again, in a challenging market when you think about other macro trends that we don't control. Our Asia-Pacific business in the second quarter, we saw some slowing in India, but that was because of the ongoing elections, that is going to pick up significantly for the second half of the year. Korea still some challenges. Taiwan, a little down, but our orders were up in Japan and Australasia and the backlog is up very healthy. So we expect Americas to snap back in third quarter and second half of the year in orders, we expect continued significant orders growth in Asia-Pacific. And our EMEA team, again, whether it's by our operating units, by our sales team, major projects, volume business, our Gen 360 products doing very well, and I'm really pleased on the infrastructure segments globally. You saw the three we called out, whether it's Shanghai Metro, Stuttgart or San Francisco, there are many more infrastructure jobs that we've been winning, and that gives us the opportunity, whether it's, again, low-rise, mid-rise, high-rise or escalators it's our full product line. And with those infrastructure jobs, we tend to get longer service commitments as well. So all of those trends, again, Americas will snap back. China will remain challenged and the other two businesses will continue to perform well as we see the second half of the year. And as I shared, I think it was one of the early questions, and maybe it was even Julian is, this is where we'll know how 25 looks. So we'll know based on backlog, how we look in '25 and '26 a little, as we exit ‘24 based on those orders in the backlog for the second half.
Judith Marks: Yeah. Good afternoon, Miguel. This is Judy. Just one other thing, I think it's important to know is that, as we look at China for this year, China revenue all in versus Otis revenue will be 15% or less. So it's continued, what that says is, we're going to grow organically 1% to 3% in revenue. And that means the other three regions are growing, while China and the denominator is growing, while China continues to obviously run into some economic headwinds, especially, in New Equipment.
Judith Marks: Thank you, Sarah. Our results in the first half reflect the strength of our service driven business model, as we remain focused on delivering value for our shareholders in the balance of 2024 and beyond. I want to once again thank Anurag and wish him well in his future endeavors, while also expressing my excitement to partner with Cristina as together, we both look forward to meeting with investors and analysts in the near future. Everyone, please stay safe and well. Thank you very much.
