Bret Eckert: Thank you, Kim and good morning, everybody. My remarks will primarily focus on the full-year results. Slides 3 and 4 detail reported net income and income excluding net unrealized margins for the three and 12-month periods of fiscal years 2015 and 2014. Reported earnings were $315 million or $3.09 per diluted share this year, compared with $290 million, or $2.96 per diluted share last year. Earnings excluding unrealized margins were $316 million, or $3.10 per diluted share in fiscal 2015, compared with $284 million, or $2.90 per diluted share in fiscal 2014. Also, fiscal 2015 earnings included the impact of colder than normal weather of $4.8 million, or $0.05 per share compared with $17.1 million, or $0.17 per share in fiscal 2014. Consolidated results for the year benefited from rate outcomes implemented in fiscal 2014 and 2015, and weather that was 8% colder than normal. Overall, spending levels for maintenance and capital activities were in line with expectations. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy of enhancing the safety and reliability of our infrastructure, coupled with constructive regulation in our service areas. Slides Five and Six provide financial highlights for our regulated operations for the three and 12-month periods. The execution of the regulatory strategy continues to drive our financial performance. Rate increases had a positive effect during the year, lifting distribution gross profit by about $71 million, and regulated pipeline gross profit by another $47 million. For the year, the annualized operating income increases from rate activity implemented during fiscal 2015 was $92 million. Slides Seven through 15 provide more detail on our rate filings in fiscal 2015. Our non-regulated operations continued its focus on the delivered gas business and represented about 5% of consolidated earnings this year, which is in line with their expected contribution level. Details on our non-regulated segment can be found on slide 16. Shifting now to the expense side of the income statement, as expected, O&M increased by about $18 million in the quarter and $37 million in fiscal 2015. In both periods, we experienced anticipated higher levels of pipeline maintenance expenses. In addition, we experienced increased employee-related costs. Interest charges decreased by $13 million for the year, primarily due to replacing the $500 million of 10-year debt with $500 million of 30-year debt at a lower rate back in October of 2014. As we anticipated, capital expenditures increased by about $140 million this year to $975 million. Over 80% of the capital expenditures were associated with safety and reliability spending, and we will be earning on over 90% of capital expenditures within six months of test year end. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016, we have announced our fiscal 2016 earnings per share guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per diluted share, excluding unrealized margins. Slides 19 and 20 detail our net income and expense projections for fiscal 2016. The midpoint of fiscal 2016 guidance represent an 8.2% earnings per share growth rate from the weather-adjusted 2015 earnings of $3.05, excluding unrealized margins. All of our growth in fiscal 2016 is expected to be driven by our regulated operations. We project regulated operations to generate net income in the range of $315 million to $335 million. We continue to expect constructive rate outcomes to be the primary driver of next year's results, and we anticipate receiving annualized increases from implemented rate activity in fiscal 2016 of between $100 million and $125 million. Our non-regulated business is expected to remain flat relative to fiscal 2015 levels, and generate net income in the $14 million to $19 million range, driven by its core delivered gas business. Non-regulated earnings are expected to contribute 5% or less of consolidated earnings in 2016. Consolidated net income for fiscal 2016 is expected to range between $329 million and $354 million, and average diluted shares are expected to range from 103 million to 105 million shares. O&M expense is projected to range between $535 million and $560 million, with a continued emphasis on pipeline maintenance spending. Additionally, our budget assumes normal weather. Other assumptions are detailed on slide 20. Slide 23 details our capital budget and its expected range of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016. This will allow us to continue our focus on systems safety and infrastructure spending, to fortify our natural gas delivery system. Thank you for your time, and now I'll hand the call back to Kim.
Bret Eckert: Well a portion of that was, but really the bigger driver, and it was anticipated, was the continued spending at the pipeline for increased pipeline integrity maintenance work. That's federal and state pipeline safety compliance work. The regulations continue to get stronger every single year, and that plans compliance for items such as integrity management smart digging, hydrostatic testing, you're doing right of way maintenance, and that's going to continue to be an area of focus for the pipeline in 2016.
Bret Eckert: It's just recurring annual maintenance, the pegging of the pipe and things of that nature is expense, the facilities, the launchers and things of that nature, that would be a capital item -- but the process of pegging or hydrostatic testing or right of way clearing is all maintenance expense.
Bret Eckert: Yes. Good question. We're going to be -- we've got our analyst day on the 18th of November. We will be announcing our spending levels. Right now our plan goes through 2018, we're going to be announcing the spending levels through 2020, and we'll update the earnings per share growth rate through 2020, and we'll put out guidance for fiscal year 2020, and we'll also talk about how we're going to fund that growth over that period.
Bret Eckert: One of the things we'll update when we come up with our updated five-year plan is the slide that we have in our deck currently that talks about the impacts to the customer, and we'll run that through 2020, and I think you will continue to see that we're able to make these levels of investments to fund it in a balanced way and to not have an impact on the customer.
Bret Eckert: The next expiring tranche debt is our June of 2017, senior notes, $250 million. We do have a forward starting swap that has fixed that rate, and then the next expiring tranche is March of 2019 $450 million senior note.
