Kim R. Cocklin: Yes. You'll have the Mid-Tex RRM, you'll have the GRIP filing that obviously comes in, Ted, as we get into the early spring. As you run through that and then, the rest of your filings are fairly typical from what we have year-over-year, commensurate with the increased investment.
Kim R. Cocklin: Oh, yes. Yes, you are correct. I mean, the $110 million to $130 million is the annual impact. If you look at the impact that we expected to have in fiscal '14, it's somewhere in the $80 million to $90 million range.
Kim R. Cocklin: Yes, I think a lot of it is related to salary expense. We have higher variable compensation in fiscal '13, as you would expect, with the stronger-than-expected earnings. We did have the new system implementation in the quarter where we did spend collections for a period of time as we go through that implementation. And we've got that turned on across all of the division. And we did have a slight run-up in bad debt expenses in fiscal 2013, that we do not anticipate reoccurring in '14. So that's a piece of it, somewhat offset, obviously, on the depreciation side. But those are really the main drivers from an O&M perspective.
Kim R. Cocklin: Yes. As you would expect, Ted, we're going to continue to be opportunistic in the timing and the nature of meeting our financing plans to fund our rate base growth opportunities, whether or not it's an overnight, whether or not it's a blocked trade, or a dribble or a forward, we'll look at all options available when we get to that point. And I'd direct you to Slide 17, where we've included our 2014 estimate of earnings, as well as average diluted shares. Our financing plans, as I've said, have been reflected in both our 2014 earnings per share guidance as well as our commitment to grow earnings by 6% to 8% annually for 2018. And we don't plan on doing anything from a financing perspective that would impact our ability to deliver on those commitments.
