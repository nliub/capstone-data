Robert Martinovich: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, ONEOK Partners reported a 48% year-over-year increase in net income. For the first nine months of 2011, net income increased 61% versus the same period in 2010. Distributable cash flow increased 50% compared with the third quarter last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.62 times. For the first nine months of 2011, distributable cash flow increased 50% compared with the same period last year, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.46 times. The higher earnings and resulting higher coverage ratio were primarily due to strong NGL optimization margins from wider NGL price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. Similar to 2008, when commodity prices were at record levels resulting in the coverage ratio of 1.45 times, we do not believe these current wide NGL price differentials are sustainable long term. In 2008, we utilized the incremental distributable cash flow to finance a portion of our $2 billion capital investment program that was completed in 2009, and we plan to utilize the incremental distributable cash flow likewise in 2011 to help fund our current $3 billion capital growth program. We increased the distribution $0.01 per unit for the third quarter, and subject to board approval, expect to increase it another $0.01 for the fourth quarter. The third quarter increase marked the 20th increase since ONEOK became sole general partner five years ago, a 49% increase. With the strong performance in the NGL segment, we’ve increased the partnership’s 2011 earnings guidance to a range of $740 million to $770 million, compared with its previous range of $630 million to $660 million. We also estimated the partnership’s 2011 distributable cash flow to be in the range of $850 million to $880 million, compared with its previous range of $735 million to $765 million. We updated our 2011 capital expenditure guidance to $1.2 billion to reflect our latest forecast. This breaks down to $1.1 billion in growth capital and $97 million in maintenance capital. We have hedges in place to lock-in margins on our expected equity volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, which is the most sensitive to commodity price changes. Our news release contains information on these hedges. At the end of the third quarter, the partnership had $128 million in cash, and no commercial paper or other short-term borrowings, a debt-to-capital ratio of 54% and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.4%. Finally, we still do not anticipate any additional financing this year. However, we will continue to monitor the capital markets and be prepared to take advantage of any opportunities. Now, Terry will review the partnership’s operating performance.
Robert Martinovich: Thanks, John. ONEOK’s third quarter net income increased by 9%, driven by the strong performance at ONEOK Partners. Results in the distribution segment were relatively flat year-over-year, while energy services had lower results due primarily to lower transportation margins from narrower realized natural gas price location differentials. ONEOK’s year-to-date 2011 standalone cash flow before changes in the working capital exceeded capital expenditures and dividend payments by $175.7 million. We expect to end the year in a range of approximately $210 million to $240 million, higher than the previous guidance range of $180 million to $210 million due primarily to revisions in depreciation estimates, including bonus depreciation following the filing of our 2010 tax returns. With the partnership’s 2011 cash distribution level, ONEOK will receive approximately $333 million in distributions this year, a 10% increase over 2010. ONEOK’s income taxes on the distributions from the ONEOK Partners’ LP units it owns are deferred, contributing to ONEOK’s strong cash flow. We also updated guidance for ONEOK in 2011. Net income is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $365 million, compared with its previous range of $325 million to $345 million. The updated guidance reflects higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment, offset partially by lower expected earnings in the distribution segment. In October we declared a dividend for the third quarter of $0.56 this year, a 17% increase since September 2010. ONEOK’s liquidity position is excellent. At the end of the third quarter, on a standalone basis, we had $650 million of commercial paper outstanding, $20.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $415.3 million of natural gas and storage, and $548 million available under our new credit facility. At the end of the third quarter, our standalone total debt to capitalization ratio was 43%. ONEOK’s significant cash flow and excellent liquidity position continue to give us tremendous financial flexibility for acquisitions, dividend increases, purchasing additional ONEOK Partners’ units and share repurchases. Now, Pierce will update you on ONEOK’s operating performance.
Robert Martinovich: No. Craig, I think from – again, from our standpoint with regards to the back to the question on timing, as we’re going to do what we did in 2008 and be able to utilize this cash flow to pre-fund at least a portion of that $3 billion. So if that ends up flatting out timing on equity offerings, that could be a result, but again that’s all part of the equation.
Robert Martinovich: Yeah, Ross, certainly our targets remain a 50/50 capitalization and debt-to EBITDA of less than four. And I think as we talked a little bit in New York, we’ve flexed a little bit last capital spend in that 2006 to 2009 period of time, but then we’re able to rebalance it prior to this latest spend. So, I mean, I think that remains our focus with those metrics, and certainly to become – remain strong investment grade credit rating.
John Gibson: Thank you, Pierce. I’d like to make some final comments before we take your questions. The recent flurry of acquisition announcements has led to more questions to us about our appetite to acquire assets. The answer remains, we’re interested. As I’ve said on several occasions, it’s our top priority for using our cash and balance sheet, either acquisitions that enable us to add a new platform for growth or ones that build on our existing lines of business. But the expectation for returns on any acquisition remain high, especially given our current slate of $3 billion plus announced projects and the $1 billion plus and growing backlog of unannounced growth projects that Terry just mentioned. All of those with very attractive returns, and certainly more attractive than some of the recently announced transactions. This means that while we remain interested in acquiring the right assets at the right price, we do not feel a heightened sense of urgency that other buyers might, since we don’t need to make an acquisition to meet our very attractive three-year growth target. We also continue to get questions about our uses of the free cash generated at ONEOK, which is approximately $200 million a year during the next three years. Our priorities remain acquisitions, dividend increases, additional investments in ONEOK Partners, and share repurchases. But our uses of cash are not determined by a formula or some set priority. We see these as dynamic and depending upon both the market and the opportunities that exist. A case in point, in hindsight we would like to have completed our $300 million share repurchase earlier than we did this year, when our share price was, of course, lower. But at the time, we were involved in other opportunities that kept that repurchase from occurring earlier. Had those opportunities fallen into place, the share repurchase might have been smaller or even pushed back. We also continue to validate that we are paying out the right amount of recurring earnings in the form of dividends. You recall that a year ago we increased our targeted dividend payout to a range of 60% to 70% from a previous range of 50% to 55% that was first established in 2006. Also when ONEOK Partners has equity needs, ONEOK evaluates investing in additional units versus other alternatives. ONEOK participated in 2008 and sat out the last two equity offerings, but has indicated an interest in future ONEOK Partners equity offerings. The good news is that we have businesses that generate a lot of cash and a structure that gives us a lot of flexibility, and a variety of tools and options to deploy that cash. Over both the short and long term, we believe we have been prudent investors of that cash in ways that create value for our investors and other stakeholders. Finally, I’d like to thank our employees who work safely and environmentally responsible everyday to create value for our investors and customers. When describing our NGL success at the partnership, I mentioned our uniquely positioned assets, higher prices and higher volumes, but I did not recognize the leadership team that makes and did make this all happen. And, of course, Terry leads that effort. Sheridan Swords is the President of that segment. Wes Christensen, our Senior Vice President responsible for operations of all of our assets and the partnership, and of course as everyone knows, you can’t capture spreads if you don’t have assets and our reliability creates significant value for our customers and our producers. And Randy Jordan, who is the quarterback that makes the calls on our optimization opportunities every day. And I might also add that this is the same team that is executing these billions of dollars worth of projects that we have underway. We never forget that our success as a company depends on the contributions of all of our employees, and I appreciate their efforts. Operator, at this time we’re ready to take questions.
John Gibson: Well, I think in general – Ted, this is John. If we were going to change our 2012 guidance, we’d have done so today. I think as we have in the past, as we progress throughout a year, we will take the opportunity based on what has occurred and what we think will occur to revise that guidance. But this time, obviously we don’t see a need to do so. I might ask Terry or Pierce if they have anything they’d like to add.
John Gibson: Well, John, we’ve talked about our interest in the Marcellus for some time now. We stated that we’re always interested in the Marcellus, but we’re trying to figure out what our competitive advantage was. We saw an advantage – a competitive advantage in the Bakken, so we chose to act upon that. We still feel the same way about the Marcellus. I mean, we continue to look for opportunities, but we’ve yet to come across one that seems to make a lot of sense for us. As it relates to the Utica, probably more potential for us than Marcellus, and our commercial people, our originators are working that area hard.
John Gibson: I think, Craig, maybe to answer your question more directly on my part anyway is just to say that, as we did in 2008, we’ll use that cash to fund our capital and it will push out any equity offerings. If your question is when will the equity offering occur for that reason, it will occur later than we thought it would. But we, like everybody else, aren’t going to tell you when we think that’d be.
John Gibson: If you assume smaller, yeah. But then – and getting back to my comment about the market and the opportunities, Terry has $1 billion of unannounced projects. Now if you think back going back to Overland Pass Pipeline how quickly we have found these large capital projects and financed them and built them, I think we got to consider that the likelihood that that unannounced $1 billion projects are going to be two or three or four years down the road. I don’t think that’s very likely. I think they’re coming fairly quickly. So, I mean, your assumptions – I mean, if your assumption is correct, then the balance falls. But I don’t think we’re done.
John Gibson: Yes, there is and they are. But, right or wrong, typically we’ve never – we’ve not done that. I think what we’ve done is, if I remember Terry’s comments specifically, they fall in the area of gathering and processing, natural gas liquids storage and possibly some more natural gas liquids pipelines.
John Gibson: Well, I’d like to add one thing, Elvira. Part of this cost is share based, the shares that we give to employees and then we accrue for incentives much like other businesses do. And as we have continued to increase our profitability, we’re accruing more dollars, and therefore having higher expense that we plan to pay out to our employees. That – and the benefit cost is included in, obviously, the 2011 numbers and is included in our 2012 guidance, but really the variance that we are experiencing much like we did in distribution, well, we’re experiencing it in all of our segments.
John Gibson: Okay, well –H. Helm, III – Barrow Hanley: It’s like a project, it’s an area that’s going to have a lot of capital put to it for a long period of time.
John Gibson: Well, let me correct myself if I did say that. When we talked about the Marcellus, what we said was that we looked at investing in the Marcellus, but could not find our competitive advantage relative to others.H. Helm, III – Barrow Hanley: Right.
John Gibson: Yes, there would be an opportunity to buy us way in, but it’d be very large and very expensive. And I’m not sure at the end of the day we’ve created a whole lot of value other than just transferring value.H. Helm, III – Barrow Hanley: Okay, thanks.
John Gibson: Well, my comments were – and just thank you for asking the question, because it gives me opportunity to clarify. We see all four of those as an opportunity. It sort of depends given point in time which one’s at the top of the list is.
John Gibson: I thought it was a good question and I appreciate your asking us, so we could kind of clarify that point.
John Gibson: Well, perhaps we don’t. There is some people who say we do, but that’s a debate to what end I’m not quite sure. But the vision of the company has been and remains to seek opportunities where we can further take advantage of our integrated operations. And by that what I mean is, we’ve for the last 10 years plus have been putting back together the pieces of the value chain to create that integrated model, because we believe it’s the – it provides the lowest cost to capital. When you look at what energy services has done for us and what it does for us today, it keeps us engaged in the marketplace. It allows us to see and participate in the downstream business of natural gas beyond what we do inside our distribution business, or for that fact besides what we do inside the partnership. So we feel that what it does do is it does create value for the business through that integration activity. The other thing – the other part of our vision, as you might recall, is that we seek to do those things – those – where we can take advantage of those capabilities that we’ve developed and also provide opportunity to develop capabilities we don’t have, which might create value in the future. We do the energy services business, the gas marketing business uniquely and differently than our competitors. And, yes, it is exposed to the volatility and the commodity price. But as we’ve talked about earlier, reducing costs we can continue to focus on creating value, and that’s the business that we think we can generate – that can generate between that $75 million and – I think it’s $70 million and $125 million, I can’t recall exactly.
Terry Spencer: John, I really don’t have much to add other than, it’s still very early. Once we get into the year, kind of see how things go then, as we’ve done in the past, we’ll make adjustments as we deem necessary.
Terry Spencer: Well, yeah, I mean, I think the fact that we’re increasing the Arbuckle capacity, and that was I think one of the first comments that I made, I think one will be significant. And I think – clearly don’t think we can discount rail possibilities as well.
Terry Spencer: Well, as I look at the landscape today, I think that if those three projects happen, I think they’ll be sufficient to meet the need. Still a tremendous amount of potential in the shale plays, particularly in the Mid-Continent, that we still see tremendous amount of opportunity there. But I think as we sit today, we think these three pipes, if they all happen, will get the job done.
Terry Spencer: Well, to answer your first question, it’s based upon that initial tranche of capacity, that 193,000. I think we feel pretty good that we’ve got a good chance to fill the balance of that capacity just based upon all the activity that we’re seeing. As I indicated earlier, the Mid-Continent continues to produce. We still get – are getting lots of request for new processing plant connections. So we feel pretty good about our chance to filling it.
Terry Spencer: Yes. Elvira, right now as it sits today – I mean, we’re still interested in the possibility of taking ethane to Canada. But, of course, we’ll build on the Bakken pipeline, which is going to be perfectly capable of handling ethane and delivering ethane into Overland Pass, and then ultimately down to the Gulf Coast. So, I mean, that capital is going to be sunk, so we’re going to want to fill that pipeline first. The fact that of the matter is, as we sit today as you look at the markets prices for ethane in Canada versus down at Mont Belvieu in the net backs in this region, we get a better price than in the product to Belvieu than we do Canada. So until we really see something significantly change there, we’re not going to have a whole lot of incentive to send ethane to Canada. Clearly, it will be an option.
Terry Spencer: Okay. Well, I mean, certainly. And, Rob, maybe you could probably add more color to that than I as it relates to benefit costs.
Terry Spencer: Elvira, I want to say one thing. I need to clarify something from a statement I made earlier about Sterling III. Sterling III right of way work, acquisition work will begin in the spring of 2012. The construction work, where we actually start throwing dirt, will begin in early 2013.
Terry Spencer: Helen, not necessarily. I think actually our view is that from an optimization standpoint we will – our volumes will reduce as we move through 2012. We will fill that volume with fee-based business as we continue to grow our infrastructure in the Mid-Continent and the Rockies. So volumetrically – I think hopefully that answers your question. Volumetrically, we will reduce how much we ship in terms of optimization.
Terry Spencer: The physical capacity – Helen, the physical capacity is going to be there. We’re going to replace some of it. A portion of it was fee-based business.
Terry Spencer: The volume that we – the volume that fills that optimization capacity we don’t use will be fee-based business coming from the internal growth projects that we’re doing upstream.
Terry Spencer: The demand for gathering system and fractionation capacity continues to be very strong. The fee for doing those businesses is going up, and our competition – competitors are charging higher rates as well. So, yeah, they will be going up.
Terry Spencer: Well, it’s hard to say that, because obviously optimization margins, I mean, they’re very volatile. So you can’t say that with the high degree of certainty that they’re going to be at a certain level. What we’re seeing is that, our customers are willing to pay and commit under firm contracts at a rate that may be slightly below, somewhat below what we would generate in terms of optimization, that’s a good bet for us. We will give up that capacity – that optimization capacity in exchange for long-term firm fees at a somewhat lower margin. We think that’s a good bet for us, and that’s what we’ve got built into our long-term plans.
