Gabe Poggi: In the case of your question on capital appointment and the first quarter was an interesting one which we kind of met our pace in terms of deploying capital. We had raised in the context of the November debt offering. But because of the strength of credit markets, we were able to realize on a number of investments we had made in previous quarters prior to raising that debt offering at attractive prices where we felt those assets had the chief fair value. So, what you see is effectively a recycling, if you will, of capital deployment in accordance with what our plan was based upon the pipeline with realizations, taking advantage of what the market gave us. And so, as we've said today we have a pretty attractive pipeline, as Mike went through, in the context of a number of investments that we will expect to deploy in the second quarter and we're waiting with some good dry powder for the next turn in the context of market volatility event which we expect will happen in the near future and we want to be ready for it.

William Sonneborn: Yes, as were getting closer to see MBS maturities and interesting enough you have this weird dynamic going on in commercial real estate between very, very low cap rates in traditional core real estate and very, very high cap rates when you go 20 miles outside of city center in the context of things that need some operational enhancement. And so, where we're seeing much more activity in terms of our pipeline is in those opportunistic situations where, again, we, through the managersâ€™ competitive relationships, can drive some enhanced value creation at those properties as a major source of return. And that pipeline has continued to build both domestically and internationally.
William Sonneborn: GAAP follows cash basically there. So, you will see lower initial returns and then much higher returns once you get through the initial acquisition cost being expensed.

Michael McFerran: Sure. When we acquire a working interest in for our natural resources strategy, acquisition possibly related to those are expensed rather than capitalized and amortized over the life or natural life of the asset. That is just really a function of GAAP as acquisition of oil and gas working interest is treated as business combinations.
Michael McFerran: There was no change in the category. We continue to look at that portfolio, while we are hopeful for good outcomes, we thought it was prudent to increase it. We are conscious that we did see some of TXC's bonds get downgraded during the quarter and price declined and some of its loans were as witnessed.  But all in all, we felt, especially as Bill referenced in his comments, we are going to be entering an environment where concerns are on Greece and sovereign debt. It could create some choppy waters. We felt it was better to strengthen the balance sheet with additional reserves before that period is experienced.
Michael McFerran: No, interest? No, we accrued interest expense from, I mean it was a small allowance from the date we did the deal in March through the end of the quarter, but it was a small amount. There was no cash interest expense on it. 
Michael McFerran: I think, look, worse case is definitely a hard statement to make, so I wouldn't want to go that far. I mean, 4% of our entire portfolio is reserved for it, which people look at historical performance leverage loans, feels pretty prudent to us. We feel very comfortable with that reserve level.  But that being said, I wouldn't want to make any statements because, frankly, I don't have a crystal ball on how the future can play out.
