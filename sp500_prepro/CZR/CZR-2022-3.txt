I will now turn the call over to Anthony.
Brian Agnew: Yes. Thanks, Tom. We had higher-than-expected hold towards the higher end of our range for the quarter, partially, as Tom mentioned, through luck, the football season has been fortunate to us so far. But beyond that, as I mentioned in the remarks, we did put a lot of tools in place. We're increasing our uptime and our percentage of in-play hold and in-play volume, which naturally translates into a higher hold product. In addition, our percentage of parlays has steadily grown and really improved in the third quarter relative to the second and first quarter. A lot of that is due to some enhancements that we made on the tech side to improve the ability for customers to visualize and to place their parlay bets. We also have our analytics team that's come over from the retail casino side that have put together a number of models that allow our traders to be able to keep the odds up during the game longer and then also to be more accurate with respect to their pricing. And so, through a combination of all of those factors, we've really been able to reduce the volatility. And you can see it when we get our results each day, even on days when we're not lucky with the outcomes, we still managed to pull off positive hold or at least hold this reasonable for a particular day. And then when we do get lucky, it really compounds and we can get some really solid, double-digit holds. So overall, we put a lot of structural hold changes in place but we were also a bit lucky in the third quarter.
Brian Agnew: Yes, I'll take that one. You definitely listed off a lot of the ones that we're aware of. So, in addition to Maryland, which will hopefully be in November and then Ohio on October 1st, you've also got Massachusetts. The date hasn't been finalized there, but it's looking pretty good for first quarter. It sounds like the retail locations will open first and then online, and we're participating in the online side of that. In addition to Massachusetts, Maine has been moving forward, that's probably going to be late this year, if not into -- sorry, late 2023 rather. We are planning to launch in Puerto Rico that could happen in the fourth quarter or might push to the first quarter. And then, as you mentioned with Nebraska as well, we will plan to have some kiosks up for our temporary casino there. And then we're going to launch a Sportsbook at Casino Windsor, up in Canada, that will be kiosks later this week. And then early next year, we'll open a full book as well.
Brian Agnew: Yes. The iCasino is a little bit more tricky. There really has to be a real coalition. There's a lot of competing interests from both within our industry and ancillary businesses that sometimes compete with us and sometimes participate with us. At this point, it's certainly possible that there could be another state that legalizes or two next year. But I wouldn't call out any particular state at this point. And just to add on to that, when we think about the model that Tom's outlaid, we really don't look at any incremental states from those that have been already passed through the legislation. So anything we get on the iCasino side or even any additional states beyond those that I mentioned would be upside to the model.
Brian Agnew: Yes. I think as Tom mentioned, this is a really scalable business. And when you're growing at 110% quarter-over-quarter, we are going to continue to staff up to handle state expansions, product improvements, those types of things, but not to the same pace as revenue and not even close to that level. We will have some slight increases in capitalized labor associated with the iCasino product next year. And any impact to the actual P&L will be fairly minimal.
Tom Reeg: Thanks, Brett. I'm going to touch a little further on the quarter, and I want to talk about October as well. In Las Vegas, very strong results in the quarter. Normal seasonality returned to Las Vegas in the third quarter. We also had a couple of headwinds that I would call out. And utility expenses for the quarter were extraordinarily high, particularly August, and we had the finish of the construction of the entrance, which caused some construction disruption. If you look at the impact of the two of those and add it back, you would end up a little bit ahead of last year on an EBITDA basis and similar from a margin standpoint. As you look into October, October was the strongest month in the history of Las Vegas for Caesars. We did over $200 million of EBITDA in October, which is up double digits versus last year on a consolidated basis. October EBITDA for bricks and mortar is pacing double-digit percentage above last year's October despite having one fewer weekend day in the 2022 period. Regional is obviously quite strong as well. It had a little bit of a margin improvement there. Strongest third quarter that we've ever had in regionals. And then we've got -- as Anthony touched on, we've got Lake Charles coming. We've got temporary casinos in Columbus, Nebraska, Danville, Virginia that will hit next year. We've got the completion of the Atlantic City spend as well and the Harrah's Hoosier Park in Indianapolis -- outside Indianapolis should finish by the middle of next year. So, a number of tailwinds, cash that you allowed us to invest as shareholders that you're going to see the fruits of going into the rest of '22 and into '23. I'd also like to touch on the strip asset sale and say that we intend to keep all of our strip assets as we move forward. We ran into a market where the cash flow of the asset continued to increase the ability of buyers to raise financing, made it a very easy decision for us to keep. I know that despite us talking about how this is and was a discretionary process for us, it created an unnecessary overhang in the stock. And I apologize to all of our shareholders for that. That was a self-inflicted error and that was me. So, we will be keeping our Vegas Strip assets as we move forward. In Digital -- October Digital inflected to positive EBITDA for us. So, we are extremely pleased that's 12 months ahead of the schedule that we anticipated. I think most of you are aware, we've got a fairly high profile liability out there with the Astros. So that will have -- that will be a swing factor in whether fourth quarter is positive as a whole, but we'd expect that we have inflected, and Digital will be a contributor as we move forward. So that's extremely exciting news for us. Great work by Eric and his team in Digital, and thank you to all of our shareholders for the capital to invest in that in Digital and the patience as we work through it. We continue to believe that on our $1.1 billion of cumulative EBITDA losses that maturity, we'll be doing in excess of 50% of that in annual EBITDA out of Digital. That business continues to outperform our expectations and really, really inflected over the last 60 to 90 days. So, we are quite pleased with that. With that, I'll flip back to the operator for questions.
Tom Reeg: Yes. For modeling purposes, Carlo, I'd expect you to be around breakeven, but I'd expect that we've got a really good shot that that's a contributor on a full year basis in '23. Obviously, that's subject to hold, but we feel very, very good about where we are. In terms of promotional environment, you've got -- we've talked for a very long time about how your customers as they come in, in new states, that's when they're taking advantage of sign-up offers that those are your highest -- that's your highest promotional spending. We've got, obviously, a mix this year of states, most of which are in their second year -- if not second full year, at least second year of operation during football season. So your promos are to your existing customers. That's typically a much smaller promotional bite than new sign-ups. But I'd also say, we have the ability to segment customers now, which we didn't last year. We've got a full year of looking at -- as you know, we had all spigots opened in Digital as we launched the business and launched the brand. Now we can look at various verticals and see what type of customer is coming in through the various channels and adjust our spend based on are we getting a return on our investment. And we made some significant changes there, led by Eric, in the last 60 days that have flowed virtually entirely basically shutting off particular segments and that cash has flowed immediately to the bottom line with no degradation in market position. So, we feel very, very good about where we're at. As I told you, this is what we've done on the brick-and-mortar side is figure out how to invest more in your best customers and less in your less profitable customers, and that's really the basic blocking and tackling that we're doing in Digital that has led to these results.
Tom Reeg: Yes. I'd say you're at a pretty good run rate. You're -- you've been around us long enough that we're never done, but we don't see any real cost that's on the sidelines. As you've touched on, we've got labor cost inflation that rolls through, but that's been for quite some time, and frankly, the labor picture continues to look better as we get quarters in the rearview mirror.
Tom Reeg: Sure, Joe. As you look at current business, you've got for us, what is a sports-dominated business at this point inflecting to profitability. Obviously, we have significant opportunity in front of us in iCasino. We think we now have the right leadership in place to attack that. So, we think that will grow from what's a fairly small contributor today, into a much more meaningful contributor. But, what I think you're referring to is as we launch, and this is not unique to us, this is throughout the entire digital space. There were a number of partnership deals signed up with media partners, with teams, with leagues that all kind of run 3 to 5 years. In our case, from let's say, the middle of last year. So you'll have some running off in a year, you'll have more running off over the next three years. And you'll look at -- there were assumptions made in terms of what you were willing to pay for those sponsorship opportunities -- those partnership opportunities that were based on customer generation, new customers to your platform. Obviously, we've got much more data today than we had before, and you're not going to be in virtually all of these cases in a launch situation anymore. So for us, that's something that runs in north of $200 million of annual expense. And you should expect as though -- and for now, that's a fixed expense for us. As long as those contracts are in place, you should expect some of them will live in a form that may not be as expensive as it is today. A fair amount of those will go away entirely, and that should flow straight to EBITDA for us if you're looking out in that ‘24, ‘25 timeframe that you laid out.
Tom Reeg: And for Vegas, Joe, if you normalize utilities, which was primarily rate in August alone, that's virtually the entire gap between Q3 of '22 or Q3 of '21. And then you have the construction disruption as well. To give you an idea, October on a preliminary basis, Vegas EBITDA margin was about 52% for us.
Tom Reeg: Sure, Steve. October is typically the strongest month in fourth quarter. November is the weakest month. Thanksgiving is not a particularly strong holiday. And your -- so November is the seasonal slowest in the third -- in the fourth quarter and then you get New Year's in December. So, if I were thinking about what does the quarter look like, October should be the best month, December should be slightly lower and November lower than that.
Tom Reeg: So, I'd say that our competitive advantage here is tying it to the existing brick-and-mortar business and our Caesars Rewards database. And it would be my preference that that remains 100% owned by the parent company. If you get to different shareholder bases for the two businesses, there's a complexity introduced that you see in -- you can see that in some of our peers in terms of when you get to different shareholder bases in the same business. But I'd tell you, you know that we're constantly focused on how do we drive shareholder value. If you get into a market where that ultimately makes sense, and that's the way to increase the pie for shareholders in total. Certainly, that's something we would consider. In the recent market environment, there hasn't been much value placed on digital assets. So it's a very easy decision as we sit here today.
Tom Reeg: Yes. Sorry, what I'd say we're doing differently is we've had most of our market torn up during the peak season. So, we've had rooms out of service, both at Caesars and at Harrah's. And obviously, the intention as we began the project was that would be finished prior to peak season of '22 and for -- there's obviously a well-known story of what's happened to -- what happened to supply chain, and we missed the peak season. So really, the results you're seeing in Atlantic City are a function of the construction disruption that we've had going on in that market, that's not a -- we're making a conscious decision to run off revenue and focus on margins. So, Atlantic City on a relative basis to the Regionals was an underperformer. In terms of overperformers, New Orleans has come back quite nicely from both the hurricane and the severe COVID restrictions that were in place in the city, and then Northern Nevada continues to be extraordinarily strong, the levels of business that we're doing in Reno and Tahoe are, frankly, beyond what we ever dreamed when we were putting this thing together a few years ago.
Tom Reeg: Yes. So, let me start this, and I'll flip to Eric in terms of -- there's two pieces here, right? There's just your normal luck and football season started pretty strong for all books. There's a couple of weeks so far that have been the reverse of that, but the bulk has been favorable to books. But when I'm saying we're positive in October, that's even adjusted for that hold. We've also made a number of changes that have improved our own hold, but I'm going to flip to Eric to talk trough.
Tom Reeg: I mean, I would say greenfield international, you never say never, but highly, highly unlikely. In the U.S., if you see a major market open, like, say, Texas, you should expect that we're going to look for a way to participate there. You've seen us in Danville, Virginia, where the temporary will open next year; Columbus, Nebraska, which is smaller where temporary will open next year. So, we will pick and choose, but you should expect it to be domestic focused.
Tom Reeg: Yes. I'd prefer not to go super deep there. But yes, John, groups are a big part of it. Group business was strong in October, same as here this week. So it's just a culmination of a significant wave of demand that has included now the group side, and we're thrilled with the way things are coming together. We're going to do over $1 billion cash room revenue in Vegas which -- for those that have been in the market and Caesars would have viewed that as impossible, not that long ago. So, we're really hitting on all cylinders here.
Tom Reeg: Yes. Certainly, yes. We think Formula One is kind of a different animal. The demand for that particular event is well beyond what we were expecting and you saw as we rolled out rates yesterday, the pricing is -- reflects that, with a lot of the big events skewed toward the second half of the year beyond normal CES coming back, things like that. There's easy comps in the first quarter with Omicron impacting '21 -- I'm sorry, '22. But as you look further deeper into the bigger groups, it's a little early to talk about traction, but it should all be extremely positive for room rates and occupancy in the market in '22 -- '23, sorry
Tom Reeg: Yes, that's accurate. And when I was talking about the utility impact, that was entirely Las Vegas. So, you're talking about if you normalize, we should have been between 48%, 49% in third quarter, and then you should see first and fourth quarters should be better than that, second should be somewhere around, let's say high-40s. But again, we manage for aggregate EBITDA, not EBITDA margin. That 50% that we're talking about is really what falls out of the operating model, not necessarily a target for us.
Tom Reeg: I'd say not quite that much. 46, I said we'd have been 48 to 49, so call it, 200 to 300 basis points.
Tom Reeg: So, we can see what other mature -- what operators in other mature non-U.S. markets generate in EBITDA margins. We've got a pretty good track record of being a margin leader. So, if you're seeing 25%, 30% away from us, I would expect that ultimately, we're going to do better than that, which should be around in line with the rest of the business.
Tom Reeg: It's -- clearly, the industry is continuing to grow. We know what's happening with our cost structure, what's going to happen with our cost structure, and we make some assumptions on. What we'll be able to do in terms of iGaming as we move forward and very comfortable with that 50% plus return on annual EBITDA to cumulative EBITDA loss measure.
Tom Reeg: Yes. So, we should be doing something in the neighborhood, if not, exceeding $1 billion of free cash flow in '23. You should expect that will be used to pay down debt. It has always been our expectation that VICI would choose to exercise the call option it has on the Centaur assets that opened in January of this year. It closes toward the end of '24. So, VICI has been very clear that they anticipate exercising that option for us. If you run that forward and assume they do it toward the end of that period, that should be about a $2.5 billion inflow to us. So, quite substantial. And by then, you'll have -- if we do nothing else, you should have another couple of billion dollars of free cash flow that we've generated between now and then, the vast majority we expect to use to pay down debt.
Tom Reeg: We think there's clear benefits to scale in the business. And we expect that we're not going to remain static over time, particularly on the iGaming space. But our -- it's important to me personally that we prove that we can generate the returns that we've laid out for the investment that our shareholders allowed us to make before we're doing any -- let's go out and try to grab significantly more share through promotions. So, you should expect us to be living in this band of market share that we've been living and that market share is ultimately not a target for us. It's can we get the return on investment that we're looking for as in the brick-and-mortar business [Technical Difficulty] share falls out of that. It's not an input.
Tom Reeg: And from a promo perspective, it's a very different business than sports. So, while you will see some advertising activity around in local market advertising, our casino product, it's a very different scale in terms of launching the sports business. So certainly easily manageable within the numbers that I laid out earlier.
Tom Reeg: Yes. So Brandt, we're -- we see the same macro going forward that others see in terms of here of what happens with continued rate rises that for instance consumer, are we facing a recession. We're not. We're certainly cognizant of what's out there. I can't point you to anything in our business in or out of Vegas that shows any slowdown in the consumer. So, we feel very good. October was obviously very strong. You see the third quarter. We know what investors are anticipating. We're not seeing that in our business to date, nor in the forward metrics that we see -- that we look at in our own business. And then, in terms of sports, sports is digital for us. We are getting over $200 million of incremental brick-and-mortar casino play out of customers that were sourced in digital. That number continues to grow. Sports in Vegas, the Raiders have been very, very good for the city, give us additional length of the stays on weekends that they're in town, generates a lot of incremental travel from visiting teams. So, that's been really a home run from the city's perspective and we've been able to benefit.
Tom Reeg: Yes. We've just started to see that business start to come back over the last quarter or so. Obviously, this Chinese New Year will be the first without -- knock on wood without impact of the virus and with the ability to travel. So that will be something we're watching closely. As you know, here, we've got Adele starting in middle of November. And like I tell you, she is an enormous draw across the board, but appeals particularly to that international high-end clientele. So we're excited about that. But Chad, it's been 2.5 years at this point, we understand that those people that were coming to Vegas to play, I don't think they stopped gambling. They found other places to do it when travel was impacted, and that's going to be a long road as we build it back.
Tom Reeg: And in terms of investment, obviously, Joe, we're doing as much EBITDA as we've ever done here. The particular assets that we're talking about had some low-hanging fruit that we were talking to potential buyers about. You shouldn't be surprised if we take advantage of that in the coming 12 to 18 months.
