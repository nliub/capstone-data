Alex Kelly: Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Merck's 2010 Second Quarter Conference Call. There are a number of items in the GAAP results this quarter such as purchase accounting adjustments, merger-related expenses, restructuring cost and also the gain on AstraZeneca's asset option exercise. We excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation table, so you can get a better sense of the underlying performance for the quarter. We've also provided tables to help you understand the revenue trends. So this quarter, there are three tables in the press release. Table #1 is the GAAP results. Table #2 is a reconciliation of our GAAP results to a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter and also for the year-to-date period. Table 3 is a supplemental non-GAAP table, which provides the sales performance for our products and our businesses, as if the company have been combined in 2009. During the call, we will be referring to Table 2 when we discuss the P&L and Table 3 when we discuss the product performance. So you may want to have those available. In addition, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs  of Merck's management and subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2009 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements we make today. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. In addition, you can see the company's SEC filings as well as today's earnings release in the tables at merck.com. This morning, I'm joined by Dick Clark, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ken Frazier, our President; and Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer. Now I'd like to introduce Dick Clark.
Alex Kelly: Thanks, Peter. Now we'd like to open up the call to answer your questions. But in order to get through as many as possible, we'd like to ask you to limit yourself to one or two questions, and note that we won't take follow-up questions. But if you do have additional questions, you're welcome to rejoin the queue. Amanda, we're ready for the Q&A.
Alex Kelly: Okay. Thanks, Ken. Thank you, everyone. That ends our second quarter earnings call. Have a good day.
Kenneth Frazier: So I'll talk about Belinta [ph]. I think from our perspective, I think it's important to recognize that we always study TRA and always anticipated that it would be added to the standard of care whether it was aspirin, PLAVIX or another medicine in PLAVIX class. So it was always our intent to have it added on top of the standard of care. And so we would think that it would be added on to Belinta [ph] as that became approved at some point and became a competitor of PLAVIX. I also think it's important to recognize that even with the, for example, 16% increase, a great deal of residual risk still remains, cardiovascular risk still remains. And therefore, there's still an important role for medicine like TRA. I also think it's important to remember the product profile, which includes the fact that we have not seen any increase in bleeding unlike some of the other medicines that are being used. So for all of these reasons, I continue to think that there are really robust prospects for our medicine like TRA.
Kenneth Frazier: So you remember that back in May, we discussed our MBV strategy, and we updated the status of the PEG-EPO program, which was discontinued. At the same time, we also highlighted the fact that a number of other programs continue on our MBV portfolio, and we also referenced biological programs that are part of our novel Biologics focus, including antibodies against HGF and IGF-1R for oncology, IL-23 for immunological indications, MK-3415A for C. difficile [Clostridium difficile], and of course, ELONVA, which is a noble follicle-stimulating hormone for fertility. So that's sort of a short description of where we are in our Biologics program. But I think it's important to recognize that we see Biologics as an important part of our future, both with respect to what we anticipate will be an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biological similars as well as novel biologics research going forward.
Kenneth Frazier: So in China. Let me just start by saying that I think we continue to be very excited about the future in China. To look at China in a monolithic way as it relates to pricing or any other aspect of our commercial strategy, I think is not how we are going to approach it. So let's start with the robust growth that we anticipate in the middle class in the urban areas of China. For those people, healthcare is still likely to be a self-pay exercise, and so we will continue to look at those market segments in a way that we can price competitively with alternative therapies. But I will say that the pricing in China has allowed both a broad access, while at the same time, also allowing strong profit margins in that country. I think the other aspect is through the government. And so there's an essential drug list, which is part of Chinese healthcare reform, and Merck participated in the Essential Drug List placing ZOCOR among other magazines on that drug list. And our experience there has been that while we had to provide substantial discounts to get entree to the Essential Drug List, the volumes have more than compensated for the pricing reductions that we have. So I think what we've seen with ZOCOR right now is an example of how in that market, we have the price in a way that creates value for that market and there's still an opportunity to be profitable in that context.
Kenneth Frazier: With SAPHRIS, I think we mentioned earlier that the current performance has been affected by destocking last year. I would say a couple of things. We continue to focus on building the brand awareness, and we're also getting reasonably good unrestricted Managed Care access about 65%. But the product right now, I would say frankly, is not where we want it to be. On TREDAPTIVE, I would say that obviously for us, the sales have not yet become material in Europe. But the real thing that we're doing on TREDAPTIVE is HPS2-THRIVE and creating a market in the U.S. I think there's still a need -- a growing awareness of HDL as its impact on cardiovascular health going forward. I would say the other issues around launches are, we are very pleased with the way SIMPONI is going, JANUVIA's continuing the launch well around the world including Japan. BRIDION is having a spectacular launch in Japan, and we look forward to DULERA. So I would just say that SAPHRIS and TREDAPTIVE has not yet become material. We continue to think TREDAPTIVE has a great future in the U.S., and we continue to work with SAPHRIS. And then I also -- it was pointed out to me that I forgot to answer quickly the Chinese IP question and I would say that on that one, we continue to proceed carefully with respect to our assets in China to make sure that we get the benefit of that market while also protecting our IP.
Kenneth Frazier: So on the SAPHRIS formulation issue, we're on track, and we plan to launch a new black cherry version to provide patients with a different, better taste option. So that's where we are on that issue. On the branded generics issue, as Dick mentioned before, I think it does vary very much market-by-market. But I want to start by saying, we have a very substantial branded generics business right now inside the company, with over 150 products available in the emerging markets based on previous portfolios of the two companies. And we see brands, as I mentioned, like ZOCOR in China just growing phenomenally. So what we intend to do is we intend to look at the branded generics business on a country-by-country basis, look at the opportunities to expand on the current portfolio of products that we have of both our traditional established products as well as our innovative products, and we intend to build on those in ways that create value for customers as well as for our shareholders.
Kenneth Frazier: On the representative levels in China, I think our current complement is about 5,000 people across the country. That's up about 1,000 since last year. So we continue to build our sales force, and we continue to penetrate deeper and deeper into the country because it's important to be able to win at the hospital level.
Kenneth Frazier: So on the Japanese launches, I'll just highlight four of them that we think are really important. ZETIA is having a very strong launch with -- it's already gained about 9% share in the Japanese market. JANUVIA, that launch is going extremely well. As we mentioned, we had sales of almost $70 million this quarter. BRIDION had a very strong initial penetration in Japan. And then lastly, we're in the midst of launching NASONEX. So we have some really strong launches underway in Japan for key products, and we're very hopeful about ongoing launches as well as the future launches that are upcoming.
Richard Clark: Sure, Chris. This is Dick. I think the issue, as Ken mentioned, is that we've put significant amount of technical and engineering resources on this both from a manufacturing and a research standpoint, and certainly, right now we are cautiously optimistic. We have begun production again of varicella. We believe that by starting production, we have a path forward. So that's good news. It's not going to have an impact on 2010 forecast because the product process cycle is significant, so there's many more production steps to go through yet. There's more quality testing to go through. There's more discussions with the agencies to go through. But I am cautiously optimistic due to the fact that, obviously, we've started production that is important. Now the second important aspect is, as Ken mentioned, is that we've started our focus on Durham, and we hope to have that, from a production standpoint, up and running in the second half of this year. And from a pediatric standpoint, with the relaunch of COMVAX, our HIB and Hepatitis B combination vaccines, all of Merck pediatric vaccines will be available in U.S. for the first time since mid-2007. So we are making that type of progress, but we'll keep our fingers crossed on ZOSTAVAX because we did start production again.
Richard Clark: I think the way we look at it as a company is that we don't look at the emerging markets as a entity onto itself. We look upon it as a country-by-country basis. And certainly, our total focus obviously is profitable growth and keeping profitable growth as the principal. In some cases, it will be joint ventures and relationships. Sometimes, there won't be inorganic at all, and sometimes there maybe an acquisition out there that may help the foundation of a particular country or via a foundation across other emerging markets. So we really take it case-by-case and what's in the best interest of that particular country. Is there a partner, is there a combination that makes sense from a value standpoint, and most importantly, does it makes sense from a profitable growth standpoint.
Richard Clark: Obviously, I'm not going to make any future comments on the arbitration based on process of where we are in today. But if you go back to why this is such an important merger to the company, it's far beyond the cost synergies. Cost synergies, in many cases, is an afterthought to why we did this merger and why we're still excited about it. First of all, the most important aspect of this merger that we continue to be excited upon is that it's a late-stage pipeline, and the research synergies from the standpoint that you're -- you have complementary franchises, and there's not much overlap and mechanism of actions, and there's great scientific and technological sharing out that is just so important for the future of the company. So the first and foremost reason why this makes sense moving forward is the scientific and research pipeline and the scientific and research technology that we're sharing across mutual franchises as we move forward. The second part to that is the product portfolio. The excitement that we see from our professional reps country-by-country when we visit there about having now a combined portfolio that can really come up with the right resolution for patients and physicians is just incredible. We're no longer a one trick pony when it comes to some franchises or to these states. We have a portfolio that can meet their needs, and I think that capability is extremely important. And then third, I think is the geographical footprint we have. The geographical footprint that we combined with the two companies, as you know, is critical to the future since we're not and will not be a U.S.-centric company. So when you look at all of those evaluations, to us, those are the most important. And obviously, REMICADE and SIMPONI are important as well, but even without those two, this makes a lot of sense to us.
Richard Clark: Your question on the new facility in Hangzhou is a pharmaceutical facility beginning with packaging products and then moving on into manufacturing. So that won't be completed in 2012, and we'll employ about 800 employees when we're finished. It's truly too early to make a comment about Sinopharm and the timing of it and activities like that since we're in, obviously, in negotiations to complete the contract. And so just stay tuned on that, we'll share that with you as soon as we can.
Richard Clark: The consumer business continues to be an important part of our strategy, particularly outside the U.S. There's the complementary nature of having RX products and OTC products. In many cases, using the same distribution channels and wholesalers and pharmacies is extremely important to us. And I think one of our areas of growth is building the business x U.S. and Europe and emerging markets. So we continue to think that's an exciting growth area for us. We're investing in it as we move forward. And obviously, outside the U.S. as well there's an Rx-to-OTC switch capability, which is also important. And there's a synergy where you can use some of the shared services capabilities between the Global Human Health division as well as the Merck Consumer Care division to get some costs synergies at the same time. So it's an important part of our future moving forward. And as you know, some of the products have lives of their own. CLARINEX can be an 80 to 100-year-old product and still perform extremely well on a global platform. We have to resource it right, and make sure that we're supporting it from a promotion end. We're very excited about the Consumer Care research pipeline as well.
Peter Kellogg: Thanks, John, it's Peter. So healthcare reform I think really is moving ahead just the way we had originally anticipated. There's no surprise this quarter. Ballpark, roughly about $44 million impact in the second quarter, and that makes sense given what we talked about as a full year impact of about $170 million. So really no update, no change really on what we've anticipated or originally modeled. We've always said that, that would probably increase next year to something in the $300 million to $350 million. So it's pretty much in line with what we've always talked about, no new surprises.
Peter Kellogg: Tim, it's Peter Kellogg. So I don't think we said it didn't impact one way or the other. What we said was our guidance has this contingency incorporated, so that really our guidance that we provided would be so achievable regardless of the outcome in this arbitration or topic. Obviously, depending on the outcome, it will make that guidance number easier or more challenging. But nonetheless, I think we feel comfortable with the guidance that we provided under different scenarios.
Peter Kellogg: Well, for 2010, obviously, the timing is a little unclear and it would be pretty relatively late in the year, but that would be something we have to really depend on the outcome. So I don't think we've said for 2010 that's one way or the other really it -- I'd say right now, what we did highlight was our guidance included REMICADE and SIMPONI in our 2010 numbers.
Peter Kellogg: Sure. So Jami, yes, I think the key thing is that we obviously -- all we've done is narrowed the range for our guidance for the full year. So we really maintain the midpoint of our guidance range and EPS. Obviously, we have, as I commented and as you pointed out, we've taken into account some of the top line pressures we see in the balance of the year. Obviously, we do expect to see the pricing impact in the second half of the year. The way we look at it, it's about mid single-digit range impact on the European revenues. Translating that to the top line, it's probably in the neighborhood of, I'm guessing, it's about $300 million or so. And obviously, we have to fully annualize that next year. The other thing is, obviously, Forex. Now the impact of Forex for us is a little complex because obviously, you have the Forex impact around the world, not just euro but yen and other currencies. And you have to net that against our hedge program. We anticipate in the second half of the year currency being a slight negative on our top line, probably something in the 1%, 2% range kind of as you go through the second half of the year. Obviously, those rates still move around. So those are the primary factors in addition to the healthcare reform. So that said, going the other way, we have a lot of activity on the expense line in the second half that will actually be driving our business going forward. And as we go into 2011, we'll be launching DULERA, we have a lot of activity going on in Japan, launching products, having a lot of success. We will be, obviously, investing in the emerging markets as you've seen announcements, and we'll continue to grow there. And obviously, our pipeline, which is a big driver for us in the future, continues to move forward with very nice progress. So you can expect to see some spending in that in the second half, a little more in the first half. So all those points combine to lead us to our guidance. But the most important thing is we didn't change the midpoint of our guidance range. We just narrowed the range as we've gone through the first half of the year.
Peter Kellogg: Sure. So Jami, obviously, we have an authorization to do up to $3 billion of share repurchase, and we haven't worked our way through that entirely. So that's on our agenda going forward, obviously. We like to, generally, on an ongoing basis, stabilize the shares outstanding; but then periodically, step in when we see a good opportunity to pick up some of our shares. And quite frankly, we see when our stock is down is a very good way of returning cash to shareholders. We know that's a focus of a lot of our key shareholders, and we take that seriously as well. I think over the last five years, as we've said in the past, our track record of returning cash flow to shareholders is phenomenal. We're in the upper 90%, above 90% range. So we could plan to continue that.
Peter Kellogg: Seamus, so obviously, I can't comment on that. But I think the key point is that -- what I meant by that is also when we have cash positions and when we see the opportunity from a window standpoint. Obviously, for us to go in the market, we have to have an open window position. So all those factors come into play, but I can't really comment on that.
