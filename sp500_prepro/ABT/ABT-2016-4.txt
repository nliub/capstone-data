Scott Leinenweber: Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1(a), Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, as well as in St. Jude Medical’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 and St. Jude Medical’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that fourth quarter financial results and guidance provided on today’s call for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today’s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott’s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Scott Leinenweber: Hi Matt, this is Scott. I’ll touch on it very quickly. As you know, market conditions continued to remain relatively challenging in China for all competitors. It is a market dynamic. We do expect as we go through the year, our performance in that business to improve. Certainly as we start to lap through some of the impacts that we started to feel in the third and fourth quarter here of 2016, you’ll see some natural improvement but we also expect our business to improve as well. If you go outside of China, though, really there’s been nice performance in Latin American and in Southeast Asia. We continue to perform very well in the U.S. on the pediatric side of the business, and then obviously as you know, optically our results have looked a bit suppressed because of our scale-down in Venezuela, so our results and our performance in 2016 actually are a little bit higher than the print would indicate there as well. So we have a number of initiatives in place in China. We’re well prepared and understand the situation on the ground, and we’ll work our way through it at the beginning of this year and we expect our growth rates there to improve throughout the year.
Scott Leinenweber: Yes, so I’ll touch base on the high power piece initially. So our updates on that are it will be later in the year. We’re looking at about the fourth quarter there for both of those high power devices. The pacemaker piece, we think is a little bit more imminent. We’ve had ongoing discussions with the FDA on that front and we feel like that one is right around the corner and should start to contribute here fairly early in the year, but the other two will be second half of ’17 items.
Scott Leinenweber: Yes, I’d just add to that as well. Obviously we’ve been working with them on the low voltage piece. There’s a bit of a gating factor and [indiscernible] generally run in parallel as well, so those discussions overlap and the process overlaps for a period as well, so there’s some sequencing to that. I will say on all of these timing items that I gave [indiscernible], all of those were contemplated along those lines in our deal model, so there’s nothing different in our deal model relative to those timelines.
Scott Leinenweber: Yes Larry, what we anticipate in diagnostics, which as Miles mentioned in his prepared remarks had some really strong growth, in particular as we hit the second half to the year and Alinity really starts to gain some traction and we gain access to some contracts on that front, so there’s some natural strength there in the back half of the year. In the first half of the year, the first quarter what you’re seeing, to Brian’s point on EPD, there was a smidgen of Venezuela in the first quarter of 2016 in diagnostics, and you’re also seeing some of that last scale-down within our genetics business which is well known and as expected in our molecular diagnostics business as well. So it’s more of a comparable item there. The underlying strength of that business is strong, and it will actually pick up steam as we head out through the year.
Scott Leinenweber: Yes Matt, this is Scott. You know, that business has been delivering at a high level here fairly consistently for years, quite frankly, since it’s been reshaped. You know, the demographics in these markets are aligned with growth for the long term. The model that we operate, quite frankly, is quite unique. There’s not another multinational company or a local company, quite frankly, that operates the model that we operate with the variety of shareholders, including the trade channel, which is a very powerful channel for us. So given the demographics and the model we operate and the strong brands that we have, we see this growth rate as highly sustainable over the long term.
Scott Leinenweber: Thank you, Operator, and thank you for all of your questions. That concludes Abbott’s conference call. A replay of this call will be available after 11:00 am Central time today on Abbot’s Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com, and after 11:00 am Central time via phone at 404-537-3406, pass code 35472887. The audio replay will be available until 4:00 pm Central time on Wednesday, February 8. Thank you for joining us today.
Miles White: Okay, first comment on St. Jude fourth quarter, CRM I think has continued to struggle. I mean, we can see that in the sales and the share and so forth. I expect that to be rectified imminently here, shortly. The good news is we’ve seen in other markets around the world when they’ve gotten their MRI claim, they have recovered and restored whatever position they have lost. That’s obviously been an overhang for them for this last year and the fourth quarter was no exception. So the good news is we expect that very shortly, but your observation about it was correct. I’ll turn to Brian here for a little bit of underlying detail on your second question.
Miles White: You know, it’s hard to speculate. I’d say in general I’m optimistic, and I’d say for a number of reasons. Some of the things that have been talked about won’t necessarily directly affect us. They may affect a number of multinationals. Obviously our new administration is pro-business, but there’s a lot of moving parts in that, as you know. The things I look for that might affect us, I think early on, I think we’re all waiting to see if there’s a tax reform package that would allow us the ability to access overseas cash and repatriate cash, et cetera. I think that would make a big difference for a lot of multinationals. I don’t really expect to see any changes in the Affordable Care Act directly affect us as much as I think they’ll affect other segments of the healthcare industry or business, and I think a lot of the effort will be pointed at other segments more than the spaces we’re in. At least as far as that is impacted, we’re primarily a diagnostic device company in the United States, so I think that to some degree, some of that impact could be favorable for us. The other things that I watch going forward is policies that affect strong dollar-weak dollar - you know, strength of currencies and so on, because we’re so geographically diverse internationally. I mean, I think one of the benefits - it’s not the primary benefit - but one of the benefits of the St. Jude acquisition is it does spread and balance us into developed market currencies a little more than we have been, and in general I’d like to see stability in the currency markets for us relative to the dollar, which has been a headwind for us for at least four years now. I think that will affect all multinationals. So you know, while there’s a lot of uncertainty around the various things that this administration appears to be making priorities out of, I’d say that there are relatively few that would impact us early on, and I think the impact is likely to be favorable, that being primarily tax and/or cash access.
Miles White: Brian is point at me to take that question, Rick. You know, there is a stepped up emphasis on cash flow, definitely, and I’d say we’ve always been a pretty strong cash flow generator. We balance our use of cash, as you know, among internal capex, dividend, share repurchase, M&A activity, and so forth. Obviously for the next little while, we’re not going to be putting a lot of emphasis into M&A. We’re going to hold back on magnitude of share repurchase, et cetera. We’re maintaining our dividend, growing it a bit, and a lot of emphasis will be put on, I’d say, rapid pay down or reduction of debt. I think that’s kind of a prudent place to be for the nearest term, so we’re being very, very prudent about cash use, cash flow, et cetera internally. I think we can do that for a while here and put ourselves back in a range where I think a conservative financial company like us would be, and get back to kind of the normal balance. You know, we’ve slowed the growth of the dividend. Will we restore that? We will, but we want to get to some targets, some leverage targets first, and we want to get there rapidly. So you know, not only in terms of our internal investments and so forth that we’ve across the board got a very emphasis on freeing and generating cash, and I’d say generally when we’ve had even a little bit of emphasis on that in the past, we’ve done very well, so that definitely is getting a lot of attention right now.
Miles White: Well, it’s already filed, but it’s--you know, I have to say, to be honest, the FDA has shifted sand on us a couple times here, so consequently we’re seeking both claims, replacement claim and adjunctive claim. We’re going parallel path on this, and I think that the performance of the product thus far ex-U.S., Europe and other countries, has been frankly excellent and does have replacement claim and so forth. I think the potential for the U.S. is extraordinary, and I think not only is the product itself an extraordinary product, but I think its value proposition is unparalleled. So--and I think the reason we’ve been able to get reimbursement in Europe and drive uptake as much as we have owes to the fact that governments there recognize the value proposition in the product as not only impact for patients but impact on the cost to the healthcare system. So I’d say at this point, I clearly can’t predict what the FDA’s timelines and so forth are going to be here, but we’re upbeat about the potential for it.
Miles White: You know, I think you’re referencing--I think you’re confusing two different products possibly here, which is high voltage versus low voltage. In effect, we’re telling you now we expect the low voltage, which is the primary bulk of use, imminently here, which you could read first quarter, not second quarter, and high voltage later in the year. Two different areas.
Miles White: No, we’re not waiting for more clarity. We’ve pretty much applied it to our entire borrowing scheme, et cetera. No surprise, we’ve been able--you know, as we went into this, we had planned for many different paths and outcomes, so it’s contemplated in our financing.
Miles White: Well, I’ll put this in a little bit of context. When we spun off AbbVie, which has now been four years ago, there was a lot of, call it post-separation, call it clean up to do. We had to take the attendant overhead in the company down, finish the back office separations and so forth with AbbVie, and as you know, we did want to reshape some of our portfolio. We sold the developed market generic drug business to Mylan and we acquired CFR and Veropharm, so we made a number of moves that we think positioned the EPB business very strongly. We had great organic internal investment in diagnostics and strong business that really wouldn’t benefit from a lot of M&A in nutrition, and the weaker part of the company that got attention from analysts, investors and others that we believe needed strengthening as a fourth leg of the company was medical devices. With the St. Jude acquisition, we think we’ve pretty directly addressed that, and having placed our investment on the cardiovascular health segment, which we believe is pretty important, we determined we didn’t have the same opportunity in medical optics to build and add on and grow onto that, like in this case J&J would, so we divested that. Now at this point, having made all those significant changes, we look at the company and say, we’ve got four very strong sectors that are very well positioned in their respective product markets and their respective geographic markets. Our challenge, or at least opportunity now looking forward for the next few years is integrate St. Jude and, frankly, focus on the organic pipelines of new products coming, and execute so that we can see the growth benefit of the strength of these four segments around the world, so in their various segments want to see the growth out of ADD for all these new systems, we want to see the growth out of St. Jude in our vascular business for their new products. Obviously the same with EPB, which has got a very good sustained growth track, and same with our nutrition business. So I’d say we’re going to be focused pretty operationally here for the next several years. That’s our intent. I think when you go through a phase where you’ve made a number of transactions, people get very transaction focused, and we’re still an operating company. That’s what we intend to be here, is an operating company, and operate them very well and grow the targets that we’ve grown. We’ve always had double-digit earnings targets and we’ve positioned ourselves in growth markets, both product and geographically for the purpose of sustaining that identity for investors to be double-digit earnings growers and so forth. With the new product pipelines and the strategic positioning of the company, I think we’re extremely well positioned to deliver on that, so that’s going to be our focus for the next few years.
Miles White: I’d say it very much expresses my view on what the future holds. You know, you always hear these comments about alignment with your shareholders. I am a shareholder, and I believe that the stock represents excellent value, and that’s why I bought the shares.
Miles White: Yes, I would say we’re in kind of a unique position relative to a lot of the traditional competitors in this space in diabetic glucose monitoring. In the past, the four major competitors there, and there’s always--there’s a lot of other smaller ones, it’s been a finger prick and a little chip business, and we have a unique position here with Libre that is a completely different product that eliminates the need for that finger stick and gives a continuous glucose read that’s, frankly, impactful for the patient, both Type 2 and Type 1 in a very different way. I think that puts us in a unique position to see a transformation of that market and to benefit from it, if not lead it. Others don’t have that, and I think that the competition in what I’ll call the traditional part of the market and the commodity nature of it, the economics of it have clearly changed negatively in the past couple of years. Ironically, J&J kind of led that, and in our case we’ve got a different position with Libre that I think gives us a unique platform to benefit as one of the disruptors. Going forward, I believe that platform has possible utility for us in other testing segments, so in our case we see a growing business that as we replace the traditional finger stick business, not only ours but others, I think there’s an opportunity there that’s a real growth opportunity and a very valuable one.
Miles White: Okay. Yes, our initial expectation will be a new lead, and I think that’s a strong position for us, we like that. But we are also seeking approval on the existing lead so that we can provide that as well for existing patients, but I think going forward we like the notion of new lead and so we expect the initial approval here to be that.
Miles White: You’ve got several drivers of growth, Matt. It’s first of all the call it growth or emergence of a middle class in a lot of emerging markets. Remember, this business is 100% focused in what characterize as emerging markets, and the middle class income growth and the growth of their healthcare systems alone is a major underlying growth driver. Most of these markets are not reimbursement-driven, they’re consumer driven and have a model that is both a combination of call it medically driven through the physician or consumer driven through the patient and the pharmacist. So all the drivers of that growth and the distribution structure and so forth say this has got strong underlying growth. I’d say it’s target rich for geographic expansion in addition, and beyond that portfolio expansion, so a lot of our organic effort internally is driven toward expansion of key therapeutic areas, expansion of product, formulation innovation on product, and distribution management. In a lot of these countries where we are the leader, we’re a leader with not that big a share, so you get all the benefits of being the leader on the shelf, the leader in distribution, the leader in breadth, et cetera, with a lot of potential expansion and share gain as well. So all of the various factors that would drive growth are pretty favorable in these geographies and product areas that we’ve targeted.
Brian Yoor: Sure, Mike. A step-up in sales throughout the year is simply what Miles message is - the stabilization of the CRM that we just talked about on the MRI claim, but also the opportunity to penetrate the accounts that we have with the combined businesses together is another contributor as we go to the market with a much broader presence of products as we call on the various accounts. Also, you’ll note that they had some nice approvals that we talked about with EnSite Precision, a key driver of growth in atrial fibrillation which has been growing in the double digits. We expect a lot of continued strong growth here, and there’s also a couple key catalysts here that we’re expecting as we move through the year, one being Confirm, which is in the heart failure space with atrial fibrillation - we expect that to be a unique contributor for the patients who have atrial fibrillation, and then also the continued contribution of neuromodulation. They recently had the Verse [ph] technology, which has had a lot of success and we expect that to continue, and then that for deep brain stimulation as well. Finally, there’s one more catalyst, and that’s HeartMate 3. It’s been doing really well in Europe. They’re the leader there. We do expect an approval of HeartMate 3 in the U.S. as we move through 2017, and that would be a contributor on the back half.
Brian Yoor: Yes, the assumed--again, on a comparable reported sales basis, which Scott--and we filed an 8-K this morning, it’s 2.5% of sales on a comparable basis, and then the AMO business will likely have sales in the first quarter of no more than a couple hundred million dollars. But as you recall, the full year was about $1.2 billion.
Brian Yoor: Oh, on the earnings per share? De minimis, Michael, on AMO. It typically is not a big earner in the first quarter just based on the pattern of spending; and again, if there is a little de minimis contribution, that also plays into the moving parts of where we’re offsetting the dilution that we’re seeing from the vascular closure divestiture.
Brian Yoor: You’re in the range. You might be a little bit north of that, Mike. We are probably closer to a dime.
Brian Yoor: You’re right, Mike, and remember this offset to--the AMO divestiture is $0.11, but we’re deploying proceeds, so the net is $0.07. That is a complete wash with otherwise what we had a long time ago with our general purpose financing, which was also negative $0.07.
Brian Yoor: Sure. Larry, I assume when you’re talking about established pharma, you’re referring to the Q1 guidance, and it is a little bit low. In 2016 it was the last, and it was just the timing of when these shipments are received of some essential medicines into Venezuela, so that’s just causing the last of our quarters of comps here. They’ll step up right to the growth rates we’ve been accustomed to seeing for several quarters now, which has been high single, even double digits based on the strength of this business. That’s with respect to EPB. With respect to the margin and how to think about it, there definitely is the impact of bringing in St. Jude into the mix, and that provides some natural accretion there. You’re probably in a very tight range there with what you referenced in terms of a profile of 22%. I think of the expansion over ’16 being roughly half mix, but also synergies. Keep in mind we’re going to improve the profiles that historically St. Jude have had, and those will ramp significantly in Q2 and even further from there as we move through the year. Then finally, gross margin, as you know, and operating margin has always been a focus for us, and if you want to deliver double-digit underlying base earnings growth, you’re going to be naturally in that 70 to 80 BPs of range based on mid-single digit top line growth.
Brian Yoor: Yes Kristen, the way to think about the build of the 700 is we took out $15 million of debt for the St. Jude transaction, and I think that was somewhere around 3.75%. Keep in mind, too, we’re also assuming some debt from St. Jude as well - that was a contributor to the addition of debt, and we just had our ongoing normal debt that had interest on it for Abbott. When you add all those things up, and then to Miles’ point say that we said we’ve contemplated the deployment of proceeds from the divestitures that we earlier talked about, that’s how you net out to the 700.
Brian Yoor: Yes, so a clean growth rate, it was in the low single digits, on the upper end of that around 2.5% or so. You know, we expect obviously as we go through the year with some of the launches, with the approvals on the MRI side, with EnSite Precision and some of these other innovations that are coming, as well as with some of the modest revenue synergies that we have baked in initially, that will ramp over time, that the St. Jude combined business with ours should accelerate growth here in 2017 over ’16.
Brian Yoor: Let me take the first one here, Bob. I think it’s safe to assume that you’re going to have greater than 50% on the back half of the year, and also contemplated in that is the benefit of this financing also that we talked about. The combination of that, the deployment of our proceeds to generate benefit and synergies ramp is just going to naturally put you into a stronger second half versus the first half. The other thing in the first quarter I’d just note is that when you think about the FX impact, it has a modestly heavier impact on Q1 relative to the other quarters, so we feel comfortable with this ramp, we know the pieces are in place, some of them are just simply comps.
Brian Yoor: Yes, we expect that market to be relatively flat as an overall market, which would be a little bit of price down offset by some modest volume.
Brian Yoor: Yes David, nothing really. We said it was going to be linear, fairly linear. We talked about the mix being heavier on the SG&A side initially and then the revenues ramping over time. I’d say the difference about us versus just putting a revenue--or excuse me, a fully synergy number out there is we go out and identify these relatively fast as part of our normal acquisition due diligence, so those are well in place, they’re in plans to be executed. We hope to do a little better maybe in the first year than what we said in linear, but we’ll see how that plays out over the year.
Brian Yoor: Yes David, let me provide some context too. I think you saw our cash flow from 2015. I think with all the things that Miles mentioned [indiscernible], you should expect to see a little bit of a step-up when you get to the K in ’16, showing the step function of the efforts we’re making here on free cash. You know, it’s tough to completely model out what the ongoing sustainable, I’ll say, free cash flow conversion is to net income in the early years with an integration, but if you look at St. Jude, they are a very powerful cash earner. We’re excited about bringing that into the portfolio. If you take away the one-time things that are transitory, David, that go with an integration, be that expense or capital that bears fruit long-term, we’ll probably be in that competitive range that you see others, probably somewhere in that 70% to 80% range. That’s probably what we’d target.
