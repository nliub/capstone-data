Strauss Zelnick: Eric, it's Strauss. On Outer Worlds, we're not releasing any specific numbers yet. It's outperforming our expectations handily. It got amazing reviews, we're super excited about it. But it's very, very early. So as we learn more, we'll disclose more.  And on Red Dead Online, we did say that we're up sequentially in the quarter. We have a lot of momentum. The new content is definitely performing. People really like it, they're engaged with it. We feel great about it, and that's pretty much where we're at, at the moment. 
Strauss Zelnick: Yes. Thanks for your question. I think a couple of notes about Social Point. First of all, there are 5 live games that are doing well in the market. So Dragon City and Monster Legends but also World Chef, Tasty Town and Word Life. So that's super exciting. And at any given time, we have 8 to 10 new titles in development at Social Point. So yes, that's roughly correct. We're really excited about what is coming to us in the future. 
Strauss Zelnick: Obviously, we've had a great quarter. We raised our outlook for the year. We're really excited about how the company is doing. This company is all about creativity, innovation and efficiency. Our goal is to make the highest-quality entertainment in the business and, in fact, in the entertainment business. More often than not, our creative teams succeed at that, and we couldn't be more grateful to them than we are. So thank you so much for joining us today. We're looking forward to the rest of our fiscal year and then beyond that as well.
