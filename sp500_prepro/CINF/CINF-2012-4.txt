Mike Sewell: Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter value creation ratio was 2.8% and we finished the year at 12.6%. That included a 5.2% contribution from our dividend to shareholders and 7.4% from the change in book value per share. The fourth quarter again demonstrated the benefits of our equity investing strategy during periods when investment income is pressured by the low interest rate environment. We received special or accelerated dividends of approximately $5 million during the fourth quarter, contributing to a $7 million or 26% increase in total dividend income. While that dividend income pace is unlikely to continue in 2013, individual common stocks in our portfolio have the propensity for dividend growth overtime, plus we invest new money in that portfolio and that helps offset declining bond portfolio yields. For full year 2012, we added new money to both our equity and fixed maturity portfolios as indicated by the annual increase in our cost basis rising 10% and 2%, respectively. Yields of our bond portfolio continue to move lower as its fourth quarter 2012 pre-tax yield of 5.01% fell 16 basis points from a year ago. Our bond portfolio’s effective duration measured 4.2 years at year-end 2012 down from 4.4 one year ago and 4.3 one quarter ago. Strong cash flow continues to enhance investment income. Consolidated net cash flow from operating activities for full year 2012 at $638 million, exceeded the full year 2011 by $391 million and exceeded 2010 by $107 million. Our stock and bond portfolios each experienced changes in fair value of less than 1% during the fourth quarter. The stock portfolio’s unrealized gains remain at over $1 billion before taxes and its fair value represents just over one quarter of invested assets. Moving to liabilities and reserve development, we continue to take a steady consistent approach to loss reserving. We aim to remain well into the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss experience reserves. For full year 2012 our Property Casualty combined ratio benefited from 10.7 percentage points of net favorable reserve development on prior accident years before catastrophe losses, up somewhat from 9.3 points in 2011 and 9.8 points in 2010. Every major line of business contributed to the 2012 favorable development that totaled $396 million including catastrophe losses. 45% of the development occurred in our largest line of business -- commercial casualty, similar to 46% in 2011. That favorable development occurred for several accident years including 39% for accident year 2011, 17% for accident year 2010, 23% for accident year 2009 and 21% for all older accident years. We continued to carefully manage expenses and our property and casualty underwriting expense ratio fell slightly despite a 0.8% point increase in the component for profit sharing commissions to agents. At year-end, our financial strength and liquidity remains stellar. We had nearly $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities at the parent company level, up 10% from a year ago. Our premiums to surplus ratio of 0.9 to 1, indicates our capacity to support continued premium growth in our insurance segments as well as provide for other capital needs. I’ll conclude my prepared comments by summarizing the contributions during the fourth quarter to book value per share. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.62. Life insurance operations added 5%. Investment income other than life insurance and reduced by non-insurance items contributed $0.40. The change in unrealized gains at December 31st for the fixed income portfolio, net of realized gains and losses decreased book value per share by $0.04. The change in unrealized gains at December 31st for the equity portfolio, net of realized gains and losses lowered book value by $0.09 and we paid $0.4075 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $0.53 during the fourth quarter to $33.48 per share. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Steve.
Mike Sewell: Paul, moving forward, I think we are strengthening some of our underwriting actions as Steven mentioned in more cat prone areas in homeowners. For example, on new business for asphalt shingled roofs, anything over than 15 years, we have already announced that we are going to an ACB loss method of payment on those particular risk in commercial lines, much higher deductibles, building deductibles rather than per occurrence deductibles. The homeowners initiatives l mentioned is on new business. Percentage deductibles they are starting to be used in the Midwest in for habitational risk. So, there is a lot going on that we think can mitigate losses. I wouldn’t want to underestimate the fact that the inspection protocol that we have, we’re inspecting a lot of property to determine its susceptibility to withstanding weather. So, it’s not just so much deductible. I would expect that we will probably have a fair amount more non-renewals of certain property that we find to be in total repair.
Mike Sewell: You know it’s an increase and again everything is done meeting by meeting, looking at all of the information that we have. I have to think that with what you’ve seen in terms of the improvement that certainly we are going to have more positive discussions. But again this is a board action and I’m telling you that’s a lively discussion with the Board. And I really can’t commit one way or the other, other than to say the dividend is and has been a very important part of what we do for shareholders in terms of capital management.
Steve Johnston: Thanks, Mike. While completing another quarter with improved underwriting performance adds to our optimism about the company’s future, we realized that your efforts must continue to build on that progress. I want to thank every associate of the Cincinnati Insurance Company for their good work, and encourage them to keep getting a little better everyday at what they do to serve our agents and policyholders. The operating environment for property and casualty insurers still has plenty of challenges. We will continually seek to improve our performance while still fulfilling our insurance promise to policyholders and providing outstanding service to agents. We appreciate this opportunity to respond to investor questions, and also look forward to meeting in person with many of you throughout this year. With Mike and me today are Jack Schiff Jr., Ken Stecher, J.F. Scherer, Eric Mathews, Marty Mullen and Marty Hollenbeck. Stephanie, we’re ready for you to open the call for questions.
Steve Johnston: Mike, let’s -- we’ve got some numbers here. I want to check real quick before we answer that. You’re looking at commercial property? That loss ratio is at the current accident year loss ratio of 28.1. It improved from 31.1 and that’s before catastrophe losses. 28.1 before catastrophe losses versus 31.1 fourth quarter a year ago. And then for the full year, which I think really for all of our lines is one to look at as well -- it’s 46.1 and 69.7 for the full year 2012 compared to 2011 and that’s current accident year before catastrophe losses.
Steve Johnston: Right. That’s a good point, Mike and we look at all the numbers obviously. But we do tend to focus on these full year numbers.
Steve Johnston: Yeah. It’s a great question and again something we think about it lot. And we do feel that we are getting improvement across the board from every area of the company pricing and maybe I will let J.F. comment on this a bit. But I’d say in general terms with the missing digit rate increases that we have been getting. We have been seeing about half come from rate and about half from other areas.
Steve Johnston: Vincent, this is Steve. And I think again, I would focus a little bit more on the year, especially if the line is volatile and has been as you know is volatile for us as workers compensation. We still feel very confident with the progress that we’re making and it’s just that most recent accident quarter for workers’ comp is going to be pretty volatile in any year. And so we are looking more to the long-term trend, the full year improvement and feel good about the improvement that we’re making. But given the volatility that can occur, your point is well taken that it’s aligned and it always has to have a close eye kept on it.
Steve Johnston: Yeah, the latter. Well, I think we are pressing for higher rate increases on the three year policy. I think the bottom line of the economy is not as robust as some businesses would like for it to be. And there they can’t tolerate quite the increase that we may ask for on the three year policy.
Steve Johnston: Yeah. There have been some volume of agency complaints, but I don’t think it’s anything drastic. Obviously, when you add agencies as we have and we have been so careful throughout our history to make certain we don’t over saturate an area. You can get into a lot of discussions with agencies about better debates. But the 65 level for this year I think is a reflection of the fact that over the last three years, we have increased the agency force in lot of areas. A lot of opportunities we appointed about $2.7 billion in property and casualty premium this year which was probably double our best year previously or certainly a significant increase over previous years. So having had a lot of conversations over the last year and a half with agencies about our long-term aspirations for growth. Number of agencies we have in our area examining the agencies that have plateaued as far as their activity levels are concerned. We think we’ve done a real good job. We have a lot more critical mass to work with right now. Having said that, there are always going to be opportunities for new appointments, there are 65 agencies that we’re projecting for this year will reflect that.
Steve Johnston: Maybe I’ll defer to J.F. to talk about the improvements because he really has been spearheading along with Marty Mullen in claims in a true team approach here and then maybe I’ll touch a little bit on the second part of your question.
Steve Johnston: I’d just add Ray, that the thing that’s kind of hard to quantify, to quality independent agents that represent Cincinnati, we’ve had the high privilege over last three nights to really spend a lot of time with the agencies and the enthusiasm they have really is contagious. And they are doing a great job out in their communities in terms of really servicing their clients and helping manage risk. All of that added up allow us to be optimistic about the future in terms of our loss pick and so forth, but it’s -- very much a bottoms-up, one risk at a time granular approach that really is driven by great independent agents and great people, field rep and underwriter level across our company. So I think credit goes to them.
Steve Johnston: I would judge it as expected. We don’t appoint an agency and expect over a very long period of time, we eventually gear up. We go through a fairly extensive interviewing process that deals with everything from financial statements of the agencies, to having members of different disciplines of our company go interview the agency about what they may be doing in personal lines, commercial lines, their access and surplus lines area, life insurance. And so we tend to hit the ground running. And we have historically always been there. So I would say it’s gone as expected.
Steve Johnston: Connecticut is a state that we will be expanding into natural as we have mentioned on previous calls. We’re very interested in diversifying our property exposures into these new states, many of which Oregon -- of course, Sandy would have proved to be strong in Connecticut, but certainly upstate New York is less cat prone. We don’t have anything on the drawing boards right now to go beyond adding Connecticut.
Steve Johnston: Paul, maybe we can tag team on this. This is Steve and just getting to start. It is kind of a two-pronged attack there and that we are growing more in areas that are less cat prone. So, overall that is going to have favorable effect. But I think importantly in the areas where we have been historically by managing the book and carefully underwriting from what we are seeing from the models, the expected losses are actually moving in a favorable direction as well. And so we’ve had action in Florida and various coastal areas as well as actions that we’ve taken in earthquake prone areas. And those that are susceptible to Midwestern convective storm activity, a lot of the things that we’re doing just every day to manage the risk profile overall or working to improve our position vis-à-vis the cat exposure.
Steve Johnston: Well, good question in fact. This is Steve. We do discuss that dividend all the time. I mean, that is important. Capital management activity for us. So every time the Board gets together, there is a lively discussion. I think we have this history of 52 years now in a row of increasing dividends. So, I think that sets a good precedent that the shareholders can latch onto. But beyond that in terms of where we are in terms of specific future guidance, I just don’t think that we are in a position to give that other than to point to our history and to point it to payout ratio is much improved and has been improving over the years and that puts us in a pretty good position and just knowing that the dividend is a very important part of our capital management strategy with shareholders.
Steve Johnston: We see various ways to deploy our capital, certainly the dividend is a big part of it. We’re growing the way we’re at the underwriting profits that we’re growing at, we see a capital strategy of investing in the business. It’s a big part of our capital deployment and so in addition to dividends, repurchases went appropriate, investing in equities. So it’s been a very successful strategy and I think a way of deploying excess capital. We really are looking at investing in the business, doing what we can to support our field people who are the strength of the company to allow them to be out, nations offices more frequently and to really service that agent. So we just -- we look at things over the long pool. We think we have a very strong and winning business model that it survived every cycle for over 60 years. And I just survived thrived in -- we are going to invest in the businesses as well.
J.F. Scherer: And then, what I’d add on the property side, we are actually up close to 10% net rate increases on commercial property increases, so that is driving the improvement in property. We are also doing a lot more loss control inspections as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. Modeling has helped us across the board, but also in the property lines as well. So, as Steve said, it’s in across the board contribution.
J.F. Scherer: Well, no question that everyone is raising rates, some more than others. Agencies right now, what we are finding and particularly this week when we are out travelling is that there are some companies that are taking some fairly sizeable increases and in some cases we are too. What we are finding at least in terms of market conditions that it’s driving quite a bit of business into the market for competition. One of our agencies report that because they perceived at some of the increases are little more than policyholders can tolerate, that there is a lot of preempting, preempted shopping of accounts that are perhaps type of thing that a carrier would want to keep, it’s driving it in the marketplace. So there is a lot going on out there, new business. We are not seeing the rouge if you will the rouge carriers and I guess everybody gets credit for being a rouge carrier sometime. But we are not seeing anyone carrier driving a new business overly aggressively. So, mid-single digits to upper single-digits -- from our standpoint is what we are seeing on improvements on renewals and I’d say just by way of commentary obviously property, cat prone property, awful lot of aggressive action being taken there.
J.F. Scherer: Vincent, this is J.F. The way I would characterize the three year policy right now is that we probably more than at any point in time, previously are strengthening the difference between what we would offer as a one year renewal price increase and a three year policy price increase. The take up rate has been a little bit less. Agencies have renewed policies on a one year policy rather than three. And that’s all right, because we’d be very happy with the kind of increases we’re asking for. And in next year, we’ll have the opportunity to revisit the policy. So, I’d say very committed to the three year policy. It’s still a very stabilizing mechanism for us. So, all-in-all good progress there, but once again strengthening the kind of increases we’re looking for in three year policy.
J.F. Scherer: Yeah. As far as initiatives to improve the loss ratios, as was mentioned -- as Steve mentioned, inspection protocols for us both in personal lines and in commercial lines, we are literally inspecting or re-inspecting hundreds of thousands of structures both in personal lines and commercial lines to give us a more confirmed view of the quality of the property that we’re insuring, the age of the roofs, the condition of the roofs, obviously with the weather being as bad as it has been, roof claims is a very significant part of what we’ve been battling. Our loss control division has expanded significantly. Specialization within our loss control division has expanded a lot. That’s manifested itself in a lot more attention in the area of workers comp but also in the casualty and property lines as well. Marty touched a little bit on some of the initiatives they’ve been involved in, in the claims area. But that’s been a significant driver for improved results.
J.F. Scherer: Ray, I guess I might add that of course, in and as much as we’ve done a lot more in lost control and just overall inspections, it’s really just kicking into full gear right now. So we’re pretty optimistic that in 2014, we’re going to get a lot of payback from that as well.
