John Gehring: Yes, Andrew. This is John. Let me comment on that. In order to prepare financial statements we have to make accounting estimates, we have in preparation of the financials we've made -- we had to make an accounting estimate that I think is conservative. The process is very fluid right now. I would tell you that process is on track from a timing standpoint. There is a lot of interest in the business but while we have made a conservative accounting estimate, I don't think we are going to speculate any further on where we think the ultimate outcome of the transactions will be. 
John Gehring: Yes. It is a capital loss carry forward, so we'll use it to shield gains on proceeds from future transactions. And I believe the loss carry forward period is five years. And we certainly have a lot of confidence that we have our time horizon to use it.
John Gehring: Yes. In fact Jonathan when you move into discontinued operations and assets held for sale, the requirements do change and so it has some impact on how you have to measure certain assets but clearly trying to make an estimate of proceeds as I refer to earlier is a big input into how you ultimately arrive at that value than to go ahead and measure impairment. It is a different methodology.
John Gehring: Yes. So this is John. I think directionally your math-- your math logic is right. I am not also a tax expert but I don't -- I am not aware of any limitations on how much you can use at a time. I think it depends on a size of the transaction and the various tax bases et cetera. So no limitation I am aware of.
John Gehring: No. I think that's the range we talked about and I think the trends I think Sean has talked about those trends our first quarter performance was as planned below where we were year ago but consistent with what we had planned and where we are in recovery process. 
John Gehring: The only thing I'll add is we said along that we are focused on investment grade balance sheet and credit rating and debt repayment is going to continue to be a priority in our capital allocation. 
Sean Connolly: Andrew, I think I said on the last quarterly call that we would look at -- we would be open to every and all structure, at the end of the day what we are most concerned about is what holistic view leads us to a decision of maximizing value for our shareholders. So we are not locked into one particular outcome or the other, we will pursue the pathway that is maximum value.
Sean Connolly: Well, number one, I think it is appropriate to be very consistent on this matter. And number two, there are obviously different views out there in terms of what is the right path forward for ConAgra. We are absolutely well aware of those views. We understand it. We understand the different perspectives in the merits of different points of view. At the end of the day though we've got a business to run, we've got business to improve. That's our responsibility. We are going to do that. But at the same time we want to make sure everybody knows that we are squarely focused on maximizing value. And that means we are not rigid about value creation. We are holistic, we are flexible but we are also pragmatic and we deal with what's real. And what's real today is we are focused on a base plan that we think has a tremendous amount of potential for our shareholders. 
Sean Connolly: Well, Jason, I'll take that. We are not going to speculate on hypothetical deals. Because there is nothing to report here. Obviously, we on an ongoing basis always look at different ways to maximize value for our shareholders and we will continue to do that. If we have something to report we'll certainly do that but I think the key message is if there is something that makes sense for our shareholders, we are absolutely going to consider it. And our shareholders should expect us to be proactively conducting that analysis on an ongoing basis. 
Sean Connolly: Jason, Tom McGough just used a phrase non-investment grade volume a little bit ago and I have been using that phrase for a long time. There not all volume in the food industry is created equal. And certainly the industry and ConAgra particular has been over committed to things like 10 for 10's and deep discount our base volume and its past. We've got an opportunity in front of us to meaningfully expand our margins and there are going to be a variety of things that go into that. Part of that is going to be being very clear eyed around maybe pieces of the business that we just haven't gotten to improving over the years. What works are plan on that, volume that is not investment grade, do we really needed in the base, so we are going to be very practical about this because big picture, we are squarely focused on margin improvement in our consumer segment as our first priority. And clearly we are developing new capabilities around pricing, trade, mix management that we lacked in the past. Our productivity work is also mission critical as is our SG&A effort. But at the end of the day we need strong brands and better innovation. And the reason for that is so we can improve volumes over time, reduce elasticity of demand and ultimately grow our market shares. And all together that is proven combination for value creation. And that means we've got to prune some non-investment grade volume in early days than we will do that and are just part of running a business well.
Sean Connolly: Sure. I think first of all it is not confused ConAgra's historical A&P spending with many of our peer companies. We've been nowhere near the level they have been were, a lot of those companies have been probably out over their skies and over investing and pull back. Historically, we've actually been the opposite case. We've under invested but I will say the Tom McGough's credit, Tom and his team were very clear eyed last year about identifying A&P spent that was probably poorly allocated, should not never have seen the light of day and they pulled it back, that established a fairly low base for us in the year ago period. And obviously that's not a position you want to be in on a perpetual basis because you lose brand health, you lose the ability to take price and ultimately you lose margins. So our plan all along has been to surgically begin to invest back to strengthen our brands, so we can build in more pricing power, build that brand equity and ultimately drive the right kind of mix and margin accretive innovation. That is our plan. And Q2 is a meaningful quarter for us in terms of kind of getting back on the horse. So we do have a series of new initiatives that are important to our franchises like Banquet and others that I mentioned before that will experience launch costs for a lack of better phrase in quarter two. These are absolutely the right investments to be making in the name of brand strength, higher price realization and stronger margins. And we will only pursue those kinds of investments when we've got a brand that we conclude is A&P ready with all the right conditions around it. So that part of our plan and it is all part of this rather multifaceted approach to margin expansion. 
Sean Connolly: Sure. Happy to tackle that, Eric. First of all, with respect to kind of my view and how it is different from others who have come here before. I am not going to comment on the past but what I will say and I mentioned last quarter is this which is when I was thinking about joining this company, one of the things that was really important to me was having confidence that I was going to be backed by a Board of Directors that were willing to embrace both change. And for those who on the call that know me, know that I am not afraid to get after bold change in order to get after opportunity. And clearly my Board, I wouldn't be here if the Board wasn't really looking for change and they have given me the latitude to do that. So when we say every thing on the table, it is on the table and we will pursue bold change. And with respect to our consumer portfolio, I think some of the stuff that Tom has got going all right now is indicative of what this portfolio is capable of. Now it requires because a number of brands and portfolio rigorous segmentation around where do you want to place your bets. But there are businesses that have historically not done much. Where there is built in latent opportunity that need unlock. If you look at the Hunt's tomato example that Tom points out, Hunt's tomato for a long time didn't lot of attention, didn't get lot of luck. The team acknowledged that Hunt's is the one tomato in the industry that is not peeled chemically. It is peeled naturally with steam and in today's environment where consumers are looking for real authentic food that is meaningful point of difference and it was sitting there for the taking all along and the team recognize the insight, they activated against the insight and they are driving significant margin expansion and growth. Similarly if you look at the business like Reddi-wip, for years Reddi-wip was number two fiddle to other larger competitors and with topping space that just happens to be artificial. While in today's day and age when you are looking at consumers that want authentic products, a real cream product is right in the wheelhouse and what the consumers are looking for. So the team recognize that opportunity, they activated against it, they got top line growth, they got margin expansion, we've got these kinds of opportunities in many different places across the portfolio. Sometimes it is a matter of recognizing the insight, sometimes there is some innovation that's needed, and there is some packaging by improvements that's needed to bring us in the modern era. But having worked on a lot of large cap food companies in my career, our portfolio quite frankly is not a whole lot different in terms of strength and potential than other portfolios. For some reason we've acted historically like it is. And I reject that notion. I think that there are spots in this portfolio where we can take the actions necessary to create value to drive margin structure. And of course the cost side of it, it is a big part of our playbook as well and as you can tell we are after that quite aggressively. 
Sean Connolly: Alexia, we will do a pretty thorough deep dived for our investors on all our efficiency programs at later date not just SG&A but trade, COGS all of that. But what I can say is that let's look at our starting point. If you first of all when you are dealing with SG&A, it is important to strip out A&P piece. So you are kind of looking underlying infrastructure based SG&A. We closed last year at about 10%. And while that is significantly below many of our peers in the industry which reflects the work that a company has already done to get cost out, it is not as low as Kraft Heinz as an example which is everybody's new benchmark, at least the pro forma they have signed up for. So we reject a notion that we are good enough. We know we got to do better. We know we've got to look at every single level we can to get there. And as a result, we've been intensively working on four pillars to make progress on SG&A. We'll have more to talk about here at later date in terms of what it adds up to. But it comes down to zero basing every single thing in our budget has been now been zero based. Spans and layers are outsourcing where it make sense to outsource and somebody else can accomplish some of the back office stuff that we do more efficiently and then procurement. Those are four areas that we are after every single day with a professional program management approach and we are making tremendous progress, we look forward to sharing bit more of deep dive on that at a later point. 
Sean Connolly: I think the way I'll answer that is I think it is always important to look at your portfolio segmentation and prioritize focus. And I think our decision on the private brands business shows that we do believe there is benefit to having a more focused portfolio. Then within the remaining business, we kind of look at -- as we look at segmentation very generically, there are businesses that you will invest to grow; there are businesses that play more of a role of profit contributors and good cash flow. And you got to be clear eyed around the businesses that are the chronically key bucket. And unless you got a plan for dealing with them, maybe somebody else values and more than you do I think that something that good portfolio managers do. Those tend to be smaller businesses but you got to look at it. So part of really running a business for strong margin expansion has been real clear eyed on some of those businesses that are either never getting attention or they're chronic headaches and you either have an answer for him or you got to do something else with them. That will just be part of our playbook as we run the business going forward. 
Sean Connolly: I think Chris possibly specifically that the number you are referencing for the mid $300 million, the number we offer in the fourth quarter for fiscal 2015. John, did you have some other color you want to add. 
Sean Connolly: Pria, I am sorry, somebody is filling in for Pria, and we are not going to comment on hypothetical in terms of other follow on deals. We don't have anything to report in that regard. Obviously, we continue to look at other ways to create value but there is really nothing to report at all in that regard beyond private brands. 
Tom McGough: Sure, Andrew. This is Tom McGough. Just let me begin by saying that we really like our portfolio and believe that there is a lot that we can do with this. And ultimately we believe investing in brands, strengthening those brands to earn higher price over time. As we look back at our investment in brands, we believe that investment is best done in three ways. One, we segment our businesses with a sharp eye to those that when we invest, do we get a return. Second, we only invest as Sean alluded to when brands are A&P ready. That's meaning having the right fundamentals, a consumer relevant proposition, marketing that has impact and accretive margins. As you can see we made very good progress on increasing our margins and we are beginning to reinvest. As you look across the portfolio, there are businesses like Marie Callender’s, Reddi-wip, Hunt's that have those fundamentals right, we are increasing our investment primarily on those businesses. And over time particularly in this fiscal year, we will have a meaningful increase in our A&P spending based on those principles and concentrating the resources on those brands. 
Tom McGough: Sure, David. This is Tom McGough again. As you look at our overall performance, the scanner result is one component of our volume. As you said, we had flat volume and net sales that was up 2% when you adjust for FX as we executed pricing. As you look at our in market performance, I would segment it into three buckets. The first is we continue to drive very strong growth particularly in brands that we've invested in, Marie Callender’s, Hunt's, Slim Jim, Reddi-wip and PAM. We've also focused a lot on winning where consumers are increasingly shopping. Those are in non-measured channels like Club, Dollar, C store. And we are outperforming in those channels. The second area that we focused on is stabilizing businesses that have been challenged in the past. We are seeing very good performance as we strengthen the fundamental on those businesses. Brands like Chef Boyardee and Orville grew in the quarter. We made a big investment in brand like PF Chang's last year. It is growing solidly, and we will be launching a similar type of initiative on Banquet going forward. And when you look at where we’ve had volume weakness, we've made strategic decision not to chase non-investment grade volume. And what that means is that we are driving trade efficiencies to eliminate negative ROI, merchandizing programs, we’re proactively pruning our line of low performing, lower margin items. We believe we are making the right trade-off to enhance our margins albeit in the near term lower volume on some of these brands. We are at the very early stages of building these new capabilities, but I think when you look at our results holistically margin growth, brand investment, pricing, we are making very good progress and that demonstrates potential that we have in our portfolio.
Tom McGough: I think what you are going to see over time is a business that continues to strengthen. Overall, we are in a very challenged environment and our performance should be roughly in line with overall category trends. But we are investing in our businesses and we would expect our volume performance to strengthen over time. 
Tom McGough: Sure. Specifically when you look at our marketing investments, I have bucketed in a couple areas. First is we are going to now invest where we are feeling really well.  Marie Callender’s is a business in our largest category frozen single serve meals that is consistently growing and we are going to increase our investment to continue to drive that business. Second on tomatoes. That is a platform that we have a strong point of difference and how we process our tomatoes. That's very consumer relevant. We've advertise that consistently. We are amplifying our efforts in that area to drive home that message. The third would be on brands like Reddi-wip that having another clear point of difference of brand that is made with real cream, 15 calories. Over last year we actually have captured the number one spot in the combined refrigerated and frozen with topping area. This is the business that continues to grow in a double digit rate. And we are going to amplify our spending on brands like that. At the same time we made progress on the getting the fundamentals right on many businesses. Healthy Choice Simply Steamers is a product with as Sean said nothing artificial, 100% natural protein, it is really resonating with consumers and we are going to invest to drive awareness on that. That's flavor or the type of investments that we are going to make. We are going to be very disciplined in investing in those brands that are A&P ready and have margins that can support that investment over time. 
Tom McGough: Sure, Robert. We have consolidated our leadership into two business groups. The frozen group and the grocery group which is essentially our grocery shelf stable and snacks refrigerator portfolio. And that is structured; we run the portfolio as Sean has said with an eye to segmentation. So one level below that is segmentation about businesses that we are going to invest to grow and those businesses that are going to drive margin and profit.
