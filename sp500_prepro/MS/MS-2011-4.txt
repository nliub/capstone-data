James P. Gorman: Well, I think, listen, the first tranche is only 14%. It is a core plank in our overall corporate strategy, which we've made very clear. We're very happy with the business. I know the margins aren't where we'd all hope they'd be at this point. But the stability of the revenues, the stability of the asset flows and the stability of the managed money gives us great confidence in the business. And frankly, we're getting close to the end of the integration period. So in a tradeoff between sort of financial management being a short-term decision around buybacks versus a long-term strategic management bides [ph] us on the long-term strategic management, which is the first tranche of the purchase. Now all of that said, it's subject to price and it's subject to an appropriate price at fair market value. So if we felt that we couldn't come to appropriate terms, we wouldn't move ahead with it. We have no problem with that.
James P. Gorman: Listen, from my perspective, you'd take these things sequentially. I think that you have plenty of opportunities to move forward with buying back stock, raising dividends or buying the remainder of Smith Barney. And what we have tried to do, as a firm over the last couple of years, is be very steady and methodical and take one step at a time.
James P. Gorman: And I would just add to that on the broader economic front, that our view has been that the U.S. is a little better off than has generally been perceived, and that Europe is more likely than not to resolve itself, although over a period of a couple of years, not a couple of weeks, which was our sort of collective attention span in the fall. So against that macro outlook, it is -- we are as Ruth said.
James P. Gorman: No, listen. How many times in the history of financial services have you seen a cross-border equity investment from one bank to another of this kind and the merger of different parts of their businesses, which we do with our securities business in Japan? And so number one, there is a strategic story here. Number two, the conversion obviously improved our capital and reduced a mandatory dividend that we were paying. And I just felt -- and maybe I'm the only one who felt this, but I felt that the world at large did not appreciate both the strategic and financial value of this transaction. And they are the second largest depository institution in the world. I think they have 70% more deposits than any U.S. institution. I may be incorrect on that, but I think I'm roughly correct. And I think because they're in Japan, they're just not just as well understood if frankly they're in our backyard. They're great partners and they have worked hard with us over the last several months to find ways to do business together. And I think that's a strategic imperative for us, to keep growing with them as partners in finding ways to do business around the world. And I just felt it was important to get that message out there.
James P. Gorman: And I think, Guy, as you -- in any industry restructuring, as the players between sort of 10 to 20 range exit, clearly that share is going to flow to those at the top. And a lot of our businesses were ranked 1, 2 or 3 in the key businesses we're in. So I think there's probably a little bit of a short-term impact, but I do think there's a longer-term change in industry structure that should play to our advantage.
James P. Gorman: And I would say, Glenn, we were never quite in the camp of the hysteria that surrounded us last October about our European exposures. We're a little bewildered by it, to be honest, which led us to a very fulsome disclosure in the appendix last quarter, and it's been netted to with the unfunded commitments this quarter. And frankly, the position has been improved by reducing one of the larger concentrated positions.
James P. Gorman: Well, I think, as we've said for a while, the most important regulatory change are the capital requirements coming out of Basel III. And I think we have a reasonably good handle on where that is likely to end. The whole Volcker, Dodd-Frank discussions are obviously still very much ongoing, as witnessed by the hearings yesterday. And listen, we've obviously done an enormous amount of work internally quantifying the impact of different rule changes, what they would mean for our business and so on. Our base case is not an extreme shutting down of all market-making activity. And we think that the original concept of Volcker, which was to ensure that deposits were not used for highly liquid prop trading, should be honored, and then we'd move forward with that. So the regulatory front remains very much in dialogue. You've got governments around the world weighing in on the U.S. position to make sure that the various international bond markets aren't disproportionally affected. You've got inventory management by large institutions like ours to ensure that we can provide liquidity for our clients. So it remains fluid as you know it. But we run all sorts of scenarios against it.
Ruth Porat: So we've had actually strength globally and across the products, as I noted, and are pleased with the strength of the global team. I think that as we've gone through the year, you've heard it on both the banking side and the sales and trading side, given the ongoing overhang of issues in the Eurozone, that's been a more challenging market, but real breadth across -- around the globe.
Ruth Porat: I don't have that. But that is, as you characterized, it's a reversal of prior losses that have bled through the P&L.
Ruth Porat: Well, with the caveat that it is -- 2 weeks is not a quarter, I would say that we ended the year feeling better about the state of the markets. There's a lot of cash on the sideline from clients. Our banking pipeline is very healthy. The equity new issue pipeline, in particular, has been on hold for quite some time, given the volatility in the market last year. The M&A pipeline is healthy. So with that very large caveat that 2 weeks is not a quarter, it's feeling a bit better. But I come back to that point, there's still uncertainty in the Eurozone, there's still issues in the macro environment. We're feeling better, but it's still early.
Ruth Porat: So we were focused on -- have been focused on the pacing of the recovery. It continues to be slow. We, therefore, felt it was appropriate to reduce headcount. But that reduction is very consistent with what we've been describing strategically and it's quite targeted. So we've been judicious in investment areas, particularly within sales and trading. So for example, in rates, which has obviously been a focal area, and as I noted, up again this quarter, up year-over-year. We've continued to make key hires in research and trading to protect and support those growth areas. We've also been making, taking steps deemphasizing and reducing balance sheet and risk in areas that are inefficient under Basel III. So for example, within our sub-investment grade securitization through 2011, we were reducing risk, which not only freed up capital and liquidity but enabled us to make some headcount reductions. But we have a strong team there that's been proactive and repositioning the business. And now they are focused on those portions within securitization, the higher-quality credit quality tranches that actually are quite consistent with the new Basel III regime. So what we've tried to do is really strike that right balance between reducing headcount where we were could, while making sure we're well positioned for the recovery, which as James said, hopefully comes sooner rather than later.
Ruth Porat: So in Institutional Securities, we did take comp down meaningfully per person this year. And as we said in the fourth quarter of last year call, we increased the deferral rate to 60% for 2011 versus 40% previously and made a number of other changes. This resulted in a higher comp expense in 2011, notwithstanding the decrease in comp per person, because 2011 was a transition year with an unusual aggregation of deferrals coming into 2011. But as James said, when we look at that deferral schedule going out from here and going most important into 2012, prior year deferrals normalize, and in fact, decline in 2012, and we do have more flexibility. So it's really about 2011 being that transition year.
Ruth Porat: Fair point. I mean, fundamentally we had consistent revenues, which underscored the stability of the business. But as James said, the margin wasn't quite where we want it. And there were a couple of factors affecting that. As we said on the third quarter call, revenues are meaningfully affected by the S&P close at the end of the year. You know that better than anyone. And the 9/30 S&P close was pretty depressed. That is used as the basis for setting Asset Management fees for the quarter. I think the good news, as we're sitting here today, is the S&P close at the end of the fourth quarter as of 12/31 was 11% higher than it was at the end of the third quarter. But that was a headwind for the fourth quarter. The other thing was there was a lighter equity issuance calendar. And again, that's market-related, and hopefully, we see some more activity coming out of that new equity pipeline, which does remain strong. The other factors, though, that were fourth quarter-specific affecting, in particular, the comp expense. One, we've been taking out -- reducing headcount of the lower performers. And so we had some severance costs in there. The other is that productivity of financial advisors has been increasing. And at higher productivity levels, they're entitled to a higher comp. And this year, that was a fourth quarter true-up. Last year, it was a fourth quarter true-down. And then the other factor I noted is market appreciation from the deferred compensation program, that's those that are invested in funds, generally flows through the revenue line and the comp expense line, so it becomes 0 margin revenue. And it was really a number of different factors. But you're right, and the focus of the team is very much focusing on expense across the board so that we can continue to drive the margin higher.
Ruth Porat: Well, we are focused on it across industries, given the strength of our banking franchise globally but in particular in Europe. So on the financial institutions side, the expectation is there will be more opportunities to help clients raise capital and restructure balance sheets. But I think the other factor to consider is it's not just within the state client base. It's really more broadly across industries. As we look at in 2008, European banks took share from U.S. banks. And that's obviously when this country was going through its capital rates focus and liquidity raise. And given that European banks are now going through similar issues, our view is that, that creates an even broader set of opportunities beyond just, say, again given the strength of our franchise, we do see this as an opportunity to gain share. On the sales and trading side, we're well positioned and hope to built off of the momentum that you've seen in some of the numbers through this year. And then on the balance sheet side, I think that, again going back to James' comments about the strength of our partnership with MUFG, it just further strengthens our ability to help clients in Europe as well.
Ruth Porat: It is real outperformance relative to the market volumes that we saw. With market volumes down, there was strength there. I would say that the strength of the team across products continues to be a real driver for the performance in the business. And you see it year-over-year, when you look at the sequential improvement, the strength that we had in derivatives goes back to a lot of the comments we've had on prior calls, which is that the team has been focused on really building adjacencies across its business, ensuring that we've built up what we did on the derivative side. You go back 2 years ago when we said we were going to build up equity derivatives. We had 3 sequential strong quarters there. And so it's really across products working together as well as they do and around the globe. So the benefit of the electronic platform is there's still delivery to clients, electronic invoice. It's working well, and it's really enabling us to stay as well connected to clients as possible.
Ruth Porat: We do feel -- I think you've summed it up well. We feel very comfortable with our exposures. We think that continuing to provide the transparency is helpful. And so we've expanded the disclosure this quarter, but we feel very comfortable with our exposures. We've got a strong business in Europe, and we remain present. But we like the way we've managed over the last several years here.
Ruth Porat: That is the primary overhang. This year -- the past year, 2011, has the dual complexity of all of the drama around the debt crisis and the downgrade for the U.S. But as James said, I think there are more signs of progress so far in the U.S., and that the ongoing uncertainty in the Eurozone continues to be a big cloud. There clearly also is some of the question marks around regulatory uncertainty. But if you were to rank them, I think the Eurozone and therefore, the issues that are holding back some clients from executing on transactions is a problem.
Ruth Porat: Well, you got a couple of questions in there. So the other sales and trading line is, as we've talked about in the past, is pretty difficult to model. I appreciate because it has a number of items in it, and it has amortizing hedges from debt we bought back in '08, '09. It has our long-term debt hedging program. It has our bank liquidity portfolio, loan book, our deferred compensation plan. And so sometimes the items all move in one direction and sometimes they're offsetting, and so therein lies the complexity. We did buy back some of our debt over the quarter. It was a small amount, and so that really didn't explain it. It was really just the various across-the-board items.
Ruth Porat: So with respect to lending an HFI, fundamentally, we are a mark-to-market shop. I think as it relates to the loan book, we obviously have a bank. We're the 15th largest U.S. depository by deposits. And so we're always considering what make sense in terms of capital and funding efficiency. I think notably in CCAR, mark-to-market loans were penalized substantially more than HFI loans. And our view is it's our responsibility to consider what makes sense for shareholders. So that is one consideration. And then the other question I think you're asking is with respect to what other repositioning under Basel III. And I think we have, as I noted, continued to focus on 2 things really within Fixed Income. One is share gains, the other is return on capital. And part of the return on capital driver is really having a forward lens to Basel III requirements and ensuring that we are positioning our businesses to be as capital-efficient under this Basel III regime. And so there should be continued benefit from active mitigation as we continue to rightsize some of the portions of businesses that are most affected by Basel III.
Ruth Porat: So on the office of reengineering, we remain confident with that $1.4 billion, that's a target by 2014. And we're also very comfortable with the run rate target for this year, which is $500 million. The key focus areas are the same as the ones we've discussed previously, the highest ones being location strategy, procurement programs and tech spending. And so that's very much on track. But I'd underscore the non-compensation expense this quarter, which as I said, was down relative to last quarter. And that's notable because the fourth quarter is typically our sequential high. And it really underscores what we're doing at the tactical level. So if you put kind of the office of reengineering in this bucket, a bigger, more strategic, however you want to define it, cost-cutting that takes longer to do because we're repositioning the way we do certain elements of the business, and put that to the side. We also have a tactical initiative, and we're pleased with our noncomps because it shows that on even across-the-board small items, we've taken a really diligent approach to ensure that we're doing all that we can to control costs. And that also persists as we move into this new year.
Ruth Porat: Yes. And the only other thing to add, this is our call option. So similarly, our call option on whether it goes to arbitration. But with respect to margins, we're continuing to focus on the mid-teen margin target, and the levers that we've talked about remain very much the ones that Greg and his team continue to be focused on. So on the cost side, the lower integration expense having cracked the back on the major expenditures with the technology platform done in the third quarter of last year. But also given the environment, the team has raised the bar in expense management. And then similarly on the revenue side, a real focus on continuing growth of the managed account platform, as I mentioned, the ongoing growth in lending and a couple of other issues. And to be clear, that's not mid -- That's not 2012 guidance, that's kind of our mid-next year guidance.
Ruth Porat: So on Basel I, why the risk-weighted asset is lower there? They're lower in part as I noted because of MBIA and also the balance sheet's lower. And so our risk-weighted assets came down in line with where the balance sheet is. With respect to Basel III, what we're really focused on, given there have been a number of changes affecting -- in guidance affecting both numerator and denominator over the last 1.5 years, when we initially gave out guidance on RWA inflation and mitigation. And Basel 2.5 has moved from an NPR to 2.5, is kind of moving around. So as a result, what we thought is the most effective and useful is to give you where we are in Tier 1 common ratio. And our Tier 1 common under Basel III, we're comfortable that it's approaching 10% by year-end 2012. In the numerator, we are deducting the MSSB NCI and adding consensus earnings. And in denominator, you have RWA inflation and passive mitigation from here through the end of 2012. We'll continue to be focused on active mitigation, to your question. And so that remains incremental upside of any active mitigation, but focused on the overall ratio here.
Ruth Porat: The offices -- we are continuing to look at where there are efficiencies in combining offices. Sometimes there are, sometimes there aren't because you have fully staffed active offices potentially within a similar area. So you can assume that across the board, we're continuing to look at where it makes sense to further consolidate or take or cut costs. And the team is being quite detailed about that. With respect to the technology spend and integration-related cost, the integration expense does come down. There is some software capitalization that then comes in, so you can't assume it's a cliff that drops off to 0. But it's come down meaningfully, and that's the real point there. And so we've hit the high point and it's rolling off. There are ongoing expenses that hit the P&L, and then the other expenses that the team can focus on include everything that you can imagine, all the details within the P&L, to do whatever we can to drive margin.
Ruth Porat: The point is the integration expense comes down to 0. But I just wanted to make it clear that from a margin impact that there are offsets to that, namely I think, the one most relevant is software capitalization. And there's some other items that continue to flow through the P&L once we're steady-state.
Ruth Porat: Well, again, it's very early, too early to say. I think that the marks that we -- the pain in credit in the third quarter was acute. And as I noted, it was modestly -- it was better this quarter but still not running at levels that are consistent with historic levels for that business. We have a very strong credit business broadly. And so there is upside as credit markets continue to heal. But I would say that, given that the major overhang, as both James and I said, is the Eurozone crisis and/or uncertainty in the Eurozone, it's too early to make a call on that.
