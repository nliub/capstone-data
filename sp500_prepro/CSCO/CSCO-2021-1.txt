Marilyn Mora: Thanks Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first quarter of fiscal 2021 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. As is customary, in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to prior-period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19 that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.
Marilyn Mora: Thanks Kelly. While the operator is queuing the line for Q&A, I'd like to remind the audience as I do every quarter that we ask you to address one question only so we have adequate time to take as many questions as possible. Michelle, I'll turn it over to you.
Marilyn Mora: Thanks Chuck. Thanks Kelly. So in closing, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal 2021 second quarter results, will be on Tuesday, February 9, 2021 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time, 4:30 PM Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. We now plan to close the call. But if you have any further questions, feel free is always to reach out to the Investor Relations team. And we thank you very much for joining the call.
Kelly Kramer: Thanks Chuck. I also want to congratulate Scott on his new role. I've had the chance to spend some time with him, and I am super excited. I think this is a very positive news for Cisco and he will be a great addition to the team. Also thanks to you, Chuck. It's been a great time working with you over the years. Now, let me provide a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by guidance for Q2. Our overall Q1 results reflect good execution with strong margins in a challenging environment. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, down 9% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.7%, down 0.9 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.2 billion, down 11%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, down 10%. Let me provide more detail on our Q1 revenue. Total product revenue was down 13% to $8.6 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 16%. As a reminder, this is a product area most impacted by the COVID environment. We saw declines across switching, routing, data center and wireless, driven primarily by the weakness we saw in the enterprise and commercial markets. We continue to see growth of the Cat 9K and the ramp of our Wi-Fi 6 products. Data center revenue declined, driven by servers. Applications was down 8%. We did continue to see strong growth in Webex with the importance of remote working. This was offset by declines and Unified Communications and TelePresence endpoints. Security was up 6%. Our cloud security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was up 2%, driven by growth in our maintenance business as well as support services. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 78% of total software revenue up 7 points year on year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q1 were $27.5 billion, up 10%. RPO for product was up 15% and service was up 8%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio in software and services. In terms of orders in Q1, total product orders were down 5%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 5%, EMEA was down 1% and APJC was down 14%. Total emerging markets were down 15% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 19%. In our customer segments, public sector was up 5%, enterprise was down 15%, commercial was down 8% and service provider was down 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q1 gross margin was 65.8%, down 0.1 points. Product gross margin was 65.3%, down 0.8 points and service gross margin was 67.1%, up 1.7 points year-over-year. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q1 net income was $2.2 billion and EPS was $0.51. GAAP results include restructuring charges of $602 million related to the plan we announced in Q1. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $30 billion. Operating cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 14%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.8 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to be in the range of flat to minus 2% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.74 to $0.76. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.
Kelly Kramer: And on RPO, Ittai, the duration hasn't changed much since we started reporting this over a year ago. About half -- slightly more than half of the total balance will get recognized in the next 12 months and the rest is longer term.
Kelly Kramer: Yeah, sure. On pricing -- and thanks for the kind words there, Paul. I appreciate it. On pricing, I'd say, our Q1 pricing is in our normal range from a product gross margin walk perspective. The rate impacts, the number that we usually talk about, it was down 1.8 points, which as you know, is in our normal kind of operating range. And just as a reminder, we've annualized all of the price increases we did a year ago for the list for tariffs. So now, this is kind of where we're stated. But I'm happy to see where we are this quarter on pricing. And even sequentially from Q4, it's better. So we're stable.
Kelly Kramer: Yeah, the orders versus revenue, it's really just timing of when things are and whatnot. That's no different than I normally go through. We know what's coming off the balance sheet with all the software. We know what's in our backlog. So it's really just the year-over-year compares. So, I feel good about the guide and you're seeing that in there.
Kelly Kramer: The only other thing I would call it is some of those companies that you mentioned have different compares than we do from a year ago as well. But Chuck hit it right. Again, data center or the compute business has a big impact due to the DRAM pricing [indiscernible] pricing down, and that hurts, and then again the campus stuff.
Kelly Kramer: Yeah, I'll start and you can add. I'd just say this, again, back to the earlier point, we have been consistently shifting the revenue mix. So, as you see every quarter and you can see it in our RPO, we are getting more and more of our revenue coming off the balance sheet with the software mix. We have continued to make progress, as you can see, on the services side. For services, it's still growing for us. And software and services together have become a much bigger part of our portfolio. So, that benefits us on the revenue guide. In terms of strength that we see, yes, this Q1 revenue, though it'd still a tough Q1, we feel better about what we see in the orders profile. And again, the growth drivers are the same growth that Chuck talked about. We see real momentum and collaboration on the Webex side. We see real momentum in security. And we're just -- I mean, that's kind of what is driving. I don't know, Chuck would add anything else.
Kelly Kramer: And we heard -- we also heard that, from the European team, they've [ph] got a lot of benefit from the stimulus. And again, when I look at the orders within public sector globally, again, a ton [ph] of it is in getting this -- it's in securities and collaborations are working from home, doing school from home and like Chuck said, the K through 12 education globally is very favorable.
Kelly Kramer: I appreciate it, Chuck. It's been great working with you. And again, I do appreciate everybody in this industry and it's been a great relationship. But. Scott, I think it's great that Scott coming. He is going to be fantastic for the Company. But thanks for everything, Chuck.
Chuck Robbins: Hey, Ittai, thanks for the comments and the questions. So, on the enterprise side, I'm not too concerned about it, honestly. We had -- we did have some pretty significant compares from the year earlier, which contributed to that. But the thing that I would call out is, we saw a pretty significant improvement in our commercial orders. I think that we were minus 23 last quarter in the midst of the whole SMB meltdown that we knew was going on, and it was minus 8 this quarter. And I'll tell you, in the US, it was even a greater improvement from that. So, that gives us a fair amount of optimism. I think they enterprise thing is going to be fine. There is -- again, we just -- we had some compare issues that I think just resulted in the math, but I don't see anything that concerns me there.
Chuck Robbins: Yeah, let me take that first, and then, Kelly, can get to the pricing question. So, Paul, I think if you look at commercial, a lot of that recovery was actually driven by collaboration and security on a global basis. And so, we feel good about that. I think that we also talked about the Cat 9K continued to show strength with double-digit demand growth, and it -- and so, what we think is going to happen is when customers go back, they are going to ensure that they have robust infrastructure. They're going to need to deal with social distancing issues. We think that in our [cloud] [ph] portfolio, you're going to see customers put high definition video in every conference room. We have technology that we've built in that I've actually seen working this week, where we have sensors in the units that -- not only will you have high definition video, but we have sensors in the units that actually monitor how many people are in a room and you get warnings if you're exceeding whatever capacity the company has defined for that room. And so, we think that the safety aspect of it will be helpful, too. So I think it's still TBD on what really happens in this space because I think 90 days to 120 days ago, there was this belief that we were going to shut down every headquarters building in the world. And now, I think people know that it's going to be a balance going back. So we've got the Cat 9K and Wi-Fi 6, which is the future modern platforms that the Company has been moving to that continue to show strength. And so, while we have to wait and see, we're optimistic about it.
Chuck Robbins: Yeah. On the enterprise front, I think the real thing that I would point out is, there are just a couple of significant transactions. And we see -- in our pipeline, we see a robust pipeline right now. We see large transactions showing up again in the funnel, which is positive. And so, if you look at across the core infrastructure, enterprises are going to upgrade their core infrastructure. They're going to build out a robust on-prem collaborate -- I mean, on-prem meaning hardware video units when they go back into the offices because everyone -- every meeting is going to have remote attendees and you're going to have to have it in virtually every conference room. So that's positive. Everybody is moving to this WAN re-architecture with SD-WAN and cloud security. So I think it's -- the short answer is, Rod, it's largely a couple of big deals a year ago and we see the funnel strengthening. So it's -- that's what gives me the optimism looking forward.
Chuck Robbins: Thanks Tim. Yeah, in the cloud vertical, the web scale space, I think what I've said historically is that we've been rebuilding these relationships and we began to see them buying our broader portfolio as a result of them believing in both the fact that we're going to be there with them and that we were investing in technology that was being built the way that they want to consume it and aligned to the architectures that they want to build. What I will tell you now is that last December, we had a launch where we talked about disaggregating our software, our hardware and that we would sell our silicon, our optics, we would sell our software stand-alone. We would sell integrated systems, whatever our customers wanted. And I can tell you that we had now won in the web scale space across every one of those facets. And so, we've seen really good progress. And I would say now, some of the new technologies that we built and had been testing and positioning are starting to show up very well in the accounts. So we're very pleased with that. On the -- and the pipeline looks very strong. So on the -- in fact, one of the comment on that, in the US, we saw service provider flat and that -- and a lot of that was strength in the MSDC web scale space. And in Europe, we saw high-teens growth and we saw really good MSDC web scale strength there as well. On the public sector, that was reasonably consistent around the world, and a lot of it was -- there was a lot of stimulus that was put in the system by lots of governments around the world. Our federal -- federal spending in the US was strong. We saw K through 12 building out a lot of infrastructure for -- while students were not there. And E-rate was strong for sure, and we think that will stay strong. And then, we saw some spending from the CARES Act in the local and municipal governments. But -- and the teams, we spent some time with the leader, particularly in US, this week. And I think he remains fairly bullish.
Chuck Robbins: Well, I think a lot of it's what I just described, right? Public sector around the world saw a lot of stimulus. And in the US in particular, we saw strength and we saw everything from Department of Defense spending to the local municipal spending. States were slightly weak, but the federal government was good. Local was good. E-rate kicked in. The new E-rate program kicked in, Jim, which contributes a lot when that gets going. And that's sort of early in its next wave. And so -- and then, we just had -- there was strength in public sector in Germany. And so, I think it was just more consistency basically. And outside the US, obviously, some healthcare. Inside the US too, there's a lot of healthcare in there in public sector, particularly outside the US.
Chuck Robbins: And I think also the web scale and the service provider, 5G build-outs, we feel like those are going to continue. But the short-term guide is a combination of what's coming off -- out of the RPO, what's in backlog and then we obviously assess the forecasts that the teams put forward and then we put the Kelly and Chuck factor on it. So it is -- and it is math to some extent, but I think that some of the things that we talked about earlier, the things that have given us -- it's hard to say super-optimistic because the numbers still aren't where we want them to be. But relative to where we were 90 days ago and how we felt or the uncertainty that we felt, we certainly feel like we have a little more visibility now.
Chuck Robbins: That's a great question. So I think on the organic versus inorganic, I should probably clarify that our strategy there hasn't changed. And I think my comments were either misstated or misconstrued last time and some folks thought that we were thinking about some significantly larger acquisition strategy. Our acquisition strategy hasn't changed, just to be clear. But we'll use a combination. I would say that right now, there -- we are probably at the peak of internal innovation that we've -- that I've seen for a long time. If you look at the platform play, the work that our service provider, Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group, is doing and some of the wins we're seeing there, the 5G backhaul and packet core wins that we're seeing and the, at least, architectural progress we're making whenever our service provider customers start building out their 5G core standalone infrastructure, we feel good about where we are. So it'll be a combination of both and -- but again, it hasn't changed. As you think about it as a service, I do want to delineate between this because there is this offer in the marketplace today from some of our competitors around consumption-based as a service, and that's largely around compute. And so, you'll see us with a similar offer, but more of what I'm talking about is looking at what aspects of our intellectual property, can we pull, can we integrate together and can we deliver as a cloud service? So I'm not necessarily talking about selling Ethernet switch ports one port at a time. We're really talking about delivering our core intellectual property. Example, take SD-WAN, cloud security, secure Internet Gateway and deliver that capability for our customers as a service in the future, which is high value, very differentiated, those are kinds of things we're thinking -- that we're working through right now. And you'll see those kind of offers come out from us over the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months.
Chuck Robbins: Yeah. Thanks Simon. I would say on the campus refresh, when you look at Wi-Fi 6, you look at the Cat 9K stuff, we're still early on, honestly. And there is -- we have a large installed base out there. And so, that's a multi-year transition that we expect will go on for some period of time going forward. On the DNA renewal stuff, that's what I was telling Meta [ph] earlier that really it is -- the first real wave of it hits sometime in '21 because if you remember, we launched that in -- I think we announced that in the summer of 2017. Kelly, is that right? And so that was a beginning of fiscal '18.
Chuck Robbins: And so, when we get to the end of fiscal '21 -- and you had a lot of early adopters, and we didn't hit scale till sort of the middle of next year. So, you're really talking about getting into FY '22 when we'll start to see that come about.
Chuck Robbins: Well, Jim, I would say the active ORAN projects around the world, we are deeply in the middle of and have actually seen a lot of benefit from one in Japan and there is a couple of others going on in other places. And we're in the midst -- we're in the middle of the packet core side of it. We're in the middle of backhaul. We're in the middle of infrastructure to support it. We're in the middle of orchestration layers. And so our teams continue to work on building out our overall stack for how we're playing that OpenRAN space over time. As it relates to the 5G stuff, you're right, where we are seeing benefit today is we're winning a lot of backhaul opportunities. We're winning a lot of packet core. I think we had seven more wins between those two in the last quarter. And I would say, the core standalone build-outs are going to largely be dependent upon the enterprise service delivery that we've talked about historically, and I still think that's probably -- I think we're starting to see some early stuff going on around the world. But I think in earnest, I would say that's going to be -- notwithstanding pandemic and everything else, it's probably going to be starting middle of next year, and it will take several years. But again, there's a lot of variables that can move that either way.
Chuck Robbins: Thanks Sami. I'd say on public sector, we feel pretty good about it actually. And when we talk to our leaders around the world, that is one area that is pretty consistent that most of them feel pretty good about and particularly in the US where it's a big piece of the business regardless of administration. It's -- there's different priorities, but they're all dependent upon tech, and so that's good. On the commercial and federal segments, I think what I would say is it -- I would say in commercial, I would assume that there was some aspect of that. But I think looking at the collaboration and security spending. I think just a lot of those mid-size enterprises were really just putting themselves in a position to continue operating in this new world we're living in right now as much as anything. I'm not sure it's significant. I'll let Kelly comments if she thinks, but we did have a comment that I made earlier that our federal team did say that the stimulus was positive, E-rate was positive. And then we saw some local muni buying that was -- they felt like was -- and the customers were telling was connected to the CARES Act, and that's probably the extent of what I've heard on this.
Chuck Robbins: Yeah, I think, first thing I'll say is that I'm really proud of our team and how hard they're working and how committed they are to our customers and making sure that we're taking care of them during these complex times. And obviously, we're trying to take care of our employees during these complex times. But I really want to just focus on thanking Kelly. It's been an incredible partnership. We've had a lot of fun, and I think that there's a lot of love in the investor community for you. We're going to miss you. But we are excited about Scott. But Kelly, thanks for everything you've done.
Chuck Robbins: And Kelly actually helped us make that choice. So you guys can feel good that she helped us with the candidates and was very very supportive on Scott's -- on the decision for Scott. So thank you all for joining us today and we'll look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
