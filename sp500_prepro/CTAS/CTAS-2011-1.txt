Bill Gale: Good evening and thank you for joining Mike Hansen and myself for our first quarter of fiscal 2011 earnings conference call. Cintas reported today growth in revenues and net income for the first quarter. We saw revenue growth in each of our operating segments. Overall revenue growth was 3.6% compared to last year. Revenues were also approximately 1.7% higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, a quarter with the same number of work days as this quarter. Earnings per share were $0.40 this year compared to last year’s $0.35 per share. Last year’s first quarter earnings did include an $0.08 charge for a legal statement on wage and hour litigation. During the quarter and continuing into September, the Company purchased 7.6 million shares of its stock. Most of these purchases were made under a 10b5 filing that went into effect when the Company entered quiet period in mid-August. The Company made these purchases from cash and did not incur any debt. At August 31st, 2010, Cintas has $369 million in cash and marketable securities. Of this amount approximately $167 million is outside the U.S., resulting from cash flow from non-U.S. operating units, leaving about $202 million of U.S. cash and marketable securities and no short term debt. In September, $72 million of the August 31st, 2010, cash was used for share purchases. This completes the authorization for share purchases by the board. The board will determine at its future meetings whether any additional authorizations will be given. As noted in our release, the share purchases had no impact on earnings per share in the first quarter, but will increase earnings per share by about $0.05 over the rest of the year. As a result, while revenue guidance for the year remains unchanged from that provided in July, our earnings per share guidance is increased by $0.05 per share on both the lower and upper end of the range given in July. We are encouraged with the recent modest growth and we believe that the North American economy will continue to improve at a relatively slow pace. As a result, Cintas will continue to focus on taking care of its customers by providing valued products and services. In addition, we will continue to enhance our existing customer relations by providing additional products and services as well as seeking out new customers in all of our business lines. Finally, we will focus on cost control and investment in acquisitions, our capital investment that meet the appropriate return criteria. As a reminder, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigations for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s current views as to future events and financial performances. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent flings with the SEC as well as in the press release issued today announcing our first quarter 2011 results. I will now turn the call over to Mike Hansen who will discuss this quarter’s results in more detail. We will then be happy to answer your questions.
Bill Gale: Well, ecommerce for Cintas is primarily driven by some of our large national customers who have requested that they do ordering, inventory checking and other various reporting through an ecommerce platform and our IT, our information technology group works closely with our global accounts division to help these national customers do that. It is not going to be an appreciable part of our business though given the fact that most of our customers are small businesses or small operations of big businesses.
Bill Gale: Yes, that is a very true statement. We were pretty much in line with expectations and as a result of that, we did not see any reason for us to increase our guidance for the year at this time. We still expect a very, very modest recovery over the rest of our fiscal year and into next.
Bill Gale: We have not seen any pressure from our suppliers that I am aware of. Therefore, we’ve had nothing to pass on to our customers. So the impact of higher cotton prices really has not impacted the cost of our garments that we are buying throughout the world.
Bill Gale: The acquisitions, as Mike indicated have picked up. You know, we told everyone on prior calls that we continue to be active looking for acquisitions, but we were very disciplined, we wanted to make sure we didn’t overpay in a declining economic environment, and it’s very difficult to predict exactly when things will develop, but we saw a nice quarter of closures and as a result of that we are very happy with these acquisitions. None of them really are large in and of themselves. The biggest one of course was the one we talked about in July and that’s still modest in size: the one that’s in the United Kingdom, the document storage business. So, right now, I would say that the acquisition pipeline is very active. We are continuing to pursue a number of targets, none of which though at this point are any significant size, but I would certainly expect there to be more acquisitions made throughout the rest of this year. Regarding the Document Management Business, continues to be a very good business for us. We are working diligently on expanding our footprint across North America and into northern Europe. We are continuing to make all acquisitions in markets that we are not in as well as acquisitions in markets that we are in where we can tuck them in. And it continues to be a very good business. The environment is such that the – paper prices remain high. Therefore, a lot of little competitors are being very price aggressive with their customers because they are after the paper so they can get the recycled price, which was set relatively good level. So – but it’s a great business, continues to be small relative to our other businesses, but we have a lot of very positive feelings towards this business going forward in how it will continue to grow.
Bill Gale: Well, Ashwin, it’s – I am not an economist, and I read everything that I can and trying to gauge what is happening, but our expectations are that we do not see a significant pickup in private sector growth, which is what is important to us. We do anticipate there will be some modest growth. And there we would expect as we go through the year the comparables become easier because we don’t have the significant drop-off that we’ve had – saw a significant drop-off last fiscal year and the year before. Then we’ll begin to see more of an impact of this revenue growth. So, I would say that as you look at our organic growth this quarter, our expectations here internally and our plan range from basically remaining at those levels going forward to slightly increasing them and that’s what drives you to the top end of the range. May be we get up to a revenue per day that’s modestly higher than it is now as we go through each quarter for the rest of the year.
Bill Gale: No. No, I don’t think it’s the new normal, but I think your assumption is correct in that it is – there will be slight improvement. We will get back to those levels of where we were several years ago when we get back up to those revenue levels assuming that there isn’t a significant spike in energy cost or a significant deterioration in the pricing environment. But it’s not going to happen this year. And I am not even sure it will happen next fiscal year unless the economy really booms and we see a lot more top line growth, which I really don’t expect at this point.
Bill Gale: Nothing that’s going to change our strategies going forward. We will certainly continue to watch it and manage it. And as I stated in my remarks, we are being very cautious and only approving capital that makes sense or acquisitions that make sense. But certainly in the more positive environment, we want to continue to invest in the business and we will continue to do so.
Bill Gale: The shredding business is a business that is – there are a lot of players in it. There are three relatively good sized players, Cintas, Iron Mountain, and Recall, and ShredX, those four big players. And I would say that all four of the big players continue to aggressive go after national business. I think Cintas is a little bit more aggressive going after local business as we continue to develop our footprint around the country. Our biggest competitive situation right now though rests primarily with the smaller players in all the market that we are at. And as I mentioned, they are being very aggressive on their pricing because they are after the paper itself to sell it to the recycler. So, while we certainly are going to continue to pursue business growth, we want to cautious that we don’t destroy the market by driving prices too far down. So, we think some of this is short term competitive situation on the part of some of the smaller players. But even with that you could see our margins were still very good. We’re still continuing to grow that business and we still have a long way to go to really fill out our footprint and grow the relatively small size businesses we have throughout the United States into much bigger entities within each of those markets.
Bill Gale: Well, we’ve only had it for three months and so far everything is great. We have a terrific management team over there. We are still working on developing our strategies on how we want to launch additional products and services. We haven’t done anything at this point. But it’s – like I said it’s only been a few months. So, so far we are very excited with the potential that exists over there.
Bill Gale: Well, I think the – everything probably saw the announcement on our tile and carpet cleaning business, which is starting out very well. It’s very small right now. We are in about 50 markets, usually with just one or two trucks within those markets, but we are finding great reception on the part of many large institutions that have been looking for a provider that can take care of their carpets and tiles and refurbish them to the point where they don’t have to replace them as quickly as they need, primarily in the hospitality and in schools, colleges, convention centers, that sort of thing. So that’s – that is one big area that we are in and then I’d say the other one in our rental business, because we are not – we certainly don’t give up on the uniform rental business is we have now a relationship with a provider of garments called Carhartt, which is a very loyal customer base that is primarily serving outdoors type activities. We now have developed a rental garment that we are having some great success in penetrating new customers with – and as well as existing customers at higher prices and we think that this is – that will be a significant advantage going forward. We are chemical dispensing, which is doing very well. So, I would say all of our businesses are looking for opportunities, but those three that I mentioned seem to be – have quite a bit of momentum right now.
Bill Gale: There is a lot more going on. It represents about half of the rental segment. So, it’s become quite large. I think the approach that we’ve taken now is instead of a bunch of individual products, we are coming up with solutions for our customers, floor care, restroom care, that sort of thing that I think it’s more of a package solution more responsive to what the customer needs as opposed to just renting them an entrance mat or renting them an air freshener. So, we’ve broadened it out to be more service oriented. Over the last few years, Mike Thompson who used to fill in on these call is now working with our COO Phillip Holloman on really trying to determine what’s the best strategic direction for that business and how to continue to grow it and add products and services and come up with solutions that are geared toward a customer and taking care of many different things as opposed to just one or two items.
Bill Gale: It depends on the business. You know you are – if it’s a uniform program, there tends to be lower profitability in the first year because you are injecting all those new garments, you got all the sales cost, the fitting cost, et cetera. And so it takes a while for that account to become profitable. But on some of the other products and services, when you go in let’s say to a customer and we are going to add tile and carpet cleaning, that’s pretty profitable stuff from day one. So it really varies depending on what the product is, what are the services and how much material cost is associated with it, what type of selling commissions are we paying, are there any setup type costs, et cetera.
Bill Gale: I think we are – I think not much higher growth than what we saw this quarter if we – as we go through the rest of the year and into next fiscal year as we continue to see an uptick in each quarter, I think you are going to see some margin improvement because we have a lot capacity that can be used.
Bill Gale: I think there were a number of factors that came into play. The large cash balances, the lack of executable, big deals at this point, the fact that many of our shareholders had been communicating with us on some of their thoughts. The price of the stock, the fact that we couldn’t earn – hardly anything on the cash that was sitting on the balance sheet, and I’d say our confidence in the future.
Bill Gale: Vance, it certainly can be because there are markets that we are not – that we don’t have a large market share in very populated parts of the country, the northeast, California, name it, the southeast. So, I think there are great opportunities there. You take Chicago, we’ve got five or six uniform rental facilities within the Chicago area. There is no reason that we wouldn’t see similar or even greater numbers of opportunities in places like Southern California or the New York area or the Washington, New York, Boston corridor type situation. So, yes, there are still continued expansions. Just because we are in one city today doesn’t mean that we can't add two or three more facilities within that same geographic area. So, we will continue to look for that. You know I think we evaluate whether it makes sense just to – branch and plant spoke scheme or to look for a nice tuck-in acquisition like we did when we bought Van Dyne Crotty here a few years ago. So, there are a number of ways to do it. As employment has finally stabilized and now is beginning to show some life and some growth and we think that you’ll begin to start seeing some of those expansions in areas as we go forward. There really aren’t a whole lot of cities in North America today though that we are not in. I think it will be primarily expanding within cities, regional areas where we are already present.
Bill Gale: No, we decided and the board advised us that they were comfortable with us establishing a 10b5 under certain parameters so that we could buy in the first quarter during the quiet period if the proper conditions warranted, which they did. So, that’s why we implemented it, otherwise we felt that we legally could not be buying our stock during the quiet period and we wanted to take care – take advantage of the opportunity if it presented itself.
Bill Gale: It was about a – well compared to last year, let’s get the number, hold on just a second. Mike did talk about it. It was 3% for the quarter and that was for the rental business – there was a 10 basis point increase in energy cost – there was a 10 basis point decrease in energy cost in the first quarter compared to last year’s first quarter, is that right, Mike.
Bill Gale: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this evening. We are glad to have reported some positive results. We will – plan to release our second quarter earnings sometime in mid-to-late December. Appreciate it very much.
Mike Hansen: Andrew, the pricing that goes into effect is during the terms of a contract is primarily in our rental business and that has been driven – that is driven by the CPI, which has been basically flat to slightly positive. So we’ve had – we’ve got – we’ve had very little pricing improvement over the last year or so in our rental business due to the fact that there is basically no inflation. With regard to renewals, we are finding that to be the most competitive situation that we are running into. Our customers, when they are at the end of their contract terms are vigorously approached by our competitors and it has resulted in a more competitive environment than we have seen. We have been talking about that for some time, and that has continued into and through this first quarter. I talked to our sales people with regard to new business, and while we have more competitive situations than we’ve had in the past, we haven’t seen the degree of pricing pressure on brand new business that we see in renewals of our existing customers. So, overall, to answer your question, we had very little impact in our revenue during the quarter from increased pricing. I would say that basically pricing for our services in the rental business is probably flat compared to where it was over the last 12 months.
Mike Hansen: It is – now, I will have to say to you it is very difficult to be given the number of products and the number of customers we have to be absolutely definitive on that, but as we look as trends, if we take out selected major products, that statement is true.
Mike Hansen: We’ve had – we’ve really seen the new business and the sales to existing customers improve this quarter over the last quarter and the last few quarters. And so we’ve – as the jobs increase, we get some benefit there as our sales force continues to focus on penetrating existing customers with additional products and services we were getting benefits. And we are seeing some pick-up in new business. So, we’ve seen some improvement in both areas.
Mike Hansen: Well, let’s start with CapEx. Yes, we – back in July we gave you a range of $125 million to $150 million for the year and we do expect that we’ll be at the high end of that range. We did have $15 million of SAP in the quarter, and that project is moving somewhat quicker than anticipated earlier and so we may have a little bit more spending on that front than we thought back in July. From a cash flow perspective, as we – as our revenue has grown throughout the quarter, we’ve seen our accounts receivable come up, we’ve seen our working capital needs come up and that’s had some drag on our cash from operating activities. But nothing that we think is unusual.
Mike Hansen: Well, as we mentioned, the add/stops did improve in the quarter and I would say that a lot of that improvement came in the uniform rental business, so we have seen our wearers pick up in the last couple of quarters, and we’ve also had some good performance on adding wearers at existing customers.
