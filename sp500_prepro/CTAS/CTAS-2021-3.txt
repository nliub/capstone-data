Todd Schneider: Thanks, Mike. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:40:00 2021  ]care scrubs, mats,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:40:00 2021 ] and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.42 billion compared to $1.45 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 50 basis points to 46.3% for the third quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's third quarter, driven in large part to lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:41:00 2021 ] and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $198.5 million compared to $170.5 million last year. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.5% in the third quarter compared to 48.0% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin is due to revenue mix. In the pandemic, the needs of businesses for personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves has skyrocketed. Even though personal protective equipment is a less predictable revenue stream with lower gross margins than the relatively consistent first aid cabinet service, personal protective equipment is a profitable product line,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:43:00 2021 ] and we continue to work with urgency to fulfill the needs of businesses. Also note that on a sequential basis, First Aid segment gross margins and operating margins have improved through the pandemic. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $160.7 million compared to $192.1 million last year. The Fire business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:43:00 2021  ] organic revenue increased 3.5%, the Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue growth rate was minus 39.7%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:44:00 2021 ] and gaming customers are largely realized within this business line. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.
Todd Schneider: Andrew, great question. We had -- as was mentioned in the prepared remarks, demand for various items around PP&E and et cetera, other items regarding the pandemic was very strong in Q3. That was a result of what was going on with case counts, and you all saw that. So, that was significant for us to the tune of about $45 million more than in Q2. We don't see that as repeating -- that level repeating in Q4, but But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:51:00 2021  ]we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in business coming back. So, you can see in our sequential improvement, what we see coming in Q4 over Q3, even without that level, that elevated level of those types of products and services. As far as restaurants, et [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:51:00 2021 ]cetera, that's certainly a component of our business. We are encouraged by what we're seeing there with folks’[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:52:00 2021  ] activity increasing, consumer spending increasing. We think people having money in their pockets via stimulus will help that, and we sure hope that small business folks who have been incredible about weathering the storm, that their demand starts to pick up even more. So, we're encouraged by what we see.
Todd Schneider: Hamzah, if I could -- this is Todd. Just to [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]expand upon what Scott’[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ] is [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ]saying, the real unknown is what is going to happen with the demand for some of these additional services that we've been able to provide, here's what we know is that demand is going to be higher in the future than it was pre-pandemic. And what's exciting is, many of our customers didn't even realize that we offered[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:50:00 2021 ] those types of products and services in the past. Let me be clear, there's nothing positive that came out of the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:51:00 2021 ]pandemic, right, but if there is any silver linings, it[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:51:00 2021 ] is the fact that our customers understand more the value that we can provide them, an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ]d[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ] as [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021  ]Scott mentioned that our NPS scores are reflecting that. And we think that is a -- the more the products and services our customers procure from us, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021  ]the more value we're bringing to them, and we think that is very positive. The other item that I think is important to understand is that we're going on 2 years now without having had a price adjustment to our customers. We have felt very passionate that it was not the appropriate time to adjust pricing when people are going through so much difficulties fighting through [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]for [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]the pandemic. And as a result of that,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ] -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]again,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ] our customers had [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]did[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]really appreciated that and truly positioned us well for the future. We look at the lifetime value of a customer and we think it is worth more than a short-term approach, so [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]. So [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]hopefully all that cover [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]co[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]lor [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]helps.
Todd Schneider: Andrew, it's Todd. Just to build upon that, everything Mike said is right on target. We're in a good position to withstand those adjustments based upon our model, our efficiencies that we can bring to market. But with all these, whether it's inflation in general,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:20:00 2021  ] or wage inflation specifically, our biggest concern is always the impact to our customers. We will manage our business, we will do it so appropriately. But if it affects our customer base, then that's a much greater concern. And we're hoping that the health of those smaller businesses has been tested, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:21:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:21:00 2021  ]we're in hopes that they can continue to expand and thrive in the new environment.
Todd Schneider: Yes. Toni, this is Todd. We are seeing very nice efficiencies from having beyond for the most part one platform for the entire organization benefiting our customers in one view of Cintas. It's benefiting our locations in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021  ]and[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021 ]the ability to share inventory, our distribution centers in order to be able to anticipate needs. It's been quite impactful and a lot of positive things that have come out of having that one platform and the efficiencies that come along with it both for the customer, but also internally have been very encouraging.
Todd Schneider: Gary, this is Todd. I think it's important to understand also the vast majority of the products and services we're speaking of, whether it's face shields, gloves, hand sanitizer, cleaning chemicals, all those, we have been offering those for decades. It's not new, right, it's just -- it's elevated. And we think it will be -- it will maybe not be at the current levels[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ], but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ]it will remain elevated into the near and maybe distant future,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ] or in the near future certainly,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ] and maybe even [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021 ]much further out than that. So that's exciting for us. We see that -- again, our customers now see that much more of a value in it, in large part because people are much more focused on hygiene and cleanliness than they were in the past. And many of our customers, they cleaned for image, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]now they are cleaning for help[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]health[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ]. And that's very much a positive we think for society, but also makes our value proposition that much stronger to our customers. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ] some very positives coming out[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]up[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ].
Scott Farmer: Andrew, if I could just add a point of clarification of the $45 million that Todd referred to, that is in the rental segment as well as the First Aid segment. You saw our First Aid segment had another very good quarter at 17.7%. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:53:00 2021 ] we're seeing demand in all of these different kinds of things in -- from all of our customers, and we're doing our best to meet those demands. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:53:00 2021 ] it's -- that $45 million is not all within the rental segment, it's in all of our businesses.
Scott Farmer: Yes. George, but to Mike's point that $45 million was spread out across the -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:54:00 2021  ]all of our divisions, it wasn't just a rental lift, but relative to what happened in Q3, I think it's important that we all keep in mind that our third quarter often is a little less predictable than the rest of our year, and this [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021 ]. This [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021  ]year was as well. It has two holidays in it with Christmas and New Year and our customers sometimes take multiple days off depending on what days[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021 ] those holidays fall on. There's always a potential of weather issues with the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021  ]snow and ice storms and things like that, and both of those things happened this year, and if you combine that with increasing COVID cases, it made it a little bit more complicated than it normally does. I would say as we went into the third quarter, we were very concerned about what we were seeing. COVID cases were on the rise. I’ve said earlier in my remarks that the economy shed jobs for the first time in s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021 ]even [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021 ]7 months in December. So, December and into January, really even into February, we saw a very difficult economic environment, but as we got into February, we started to see our recurring revenues[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021  ] start to pick back up. Cases were dropping dramatically from -- I want to say, maybe the second week in January, the expected restrictions, the [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]indi[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]c[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021 ]ernible[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]govern[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]ce [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]that we thought were going to put on businesses didn't fully materialize. And so, the -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021  ]we built some momentum in February that we continued[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021 ] to see as we moved into March, and I think that is reflected in the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter.
Scott Farmer: We're very pleased with our pipeline. Our sales rep productivity continues to be at very, very high levels. We believe that the -- our value proposition is resonating today in the economy more than ever. So we're excited about our opportunities as we look out into the future. Our[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]--[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]T[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021 ]t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]here are 16 million or roughly 16 million businesses in the United States and Canada, and we do business with a million of them. And we really like our opportunity as we approach hopefully the end of this pandemic, and a more normalized economy of our ability to do [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021  ]attract new customers. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] we're -- the pipeline is relatively full,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] and the reps are performing at high levels, even considering the fact that many times they're making sales calls over a virtual Teams [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ]teams [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021  ]call or Zoom call and being successful in doing it. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] we're excited about getting past this pandemic and getting into a normal economy. We think we'll be -- we are well-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021 ]positioned to take advantage of that.
Scott Farmer: Hamzah, that’s tough for us to predict. I'm not sure that I'm going to go out and say that we're going to be doing better than we were from a percentage growth standpoint, post-pandemic and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021  ]than [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021 ]we were pre-pandemic. But as I’ve said, we really like where we're positioned. We've made a lot of investments in the business that we think are beginning to pay off, that allow us to move quicker to be a better supplier to customers. Our customer satisfaction rates that we measure with Net Promoter S[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021  ]cores are at all-time highs, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021  ]we have opened up new segments of opportunity for us. We have new products and services that we can offer to more and more businesses. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ] I'll just answer that by saying, we think we're very well-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]positioned, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ]we're excited about the future.
Scott Farmer: Yes, Andrew, it's been a -- it certainly has been a different environment operating in the last four quarters, and one that's been pretty unpredictable. I think what we'll see, what we've guided to in the fourth quarter and likely will get us off to a start in the first quarter of '22,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021  ] is the continued reopening of businesses and getting those businesses back to somewhat normalized operations. We were on a nice trajectory of that towards the end of our first quarter of [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]this year and into our second quarter that certainly took a pause, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021  ]we've got a lot of customers that still are either not opened or at limited capacity. And so, I think as we look at the next couple o[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]f [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]quarters, maybe even the most of fiscal '22, it's going to be about fully reopening the economy and getting those -- getting our customers and other businesses back to healthy operating environments. That means we'll take businesses off of held [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]a health [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ]status in the rental division. We'll start this [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ]to service First Aid cabinets again at a greater pace. We'll start to understand the needs,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ] when they open and come off of hold, how can we help them in this new type of environment with all of the things that we've talked about that have been important. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:02:00 2021 ] I think it's going to be more of that. The reopening of the economy and getting back to some normal type of process than anything else.
Scott Farmer: Well, if we start with CapEx, we're still sort of managing through the unpredictability of the economy. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] we're probably a little more conservative right now and will be in the fourth quarter. But over time, I think our CapEx spend as the economy turns around and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021  ]will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ]get back to a more normalized historical type,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] and that's typically roughly 60% based on growth and 40% on maintenance. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] I think we'll continue to see that type of spend. We do generate a lot of cash. We've got a very strong balance sheet. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] we would be interested in acquisitions in all of our businesses. And then,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:25:00 2021  ] obviously, the dividend is important to our shareholders. We have continued to be in a position where we could increase the dividend to our shareholders every year since we went public, and obviously that is a streak that we'd like to see continue. And then, yes, finally, we do have roughly a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]$1 billion left on our authorization, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]that is more sort of opportunistic from time-to-time as we see opportunities to acquire our own stock. And so, should we be in a position where we're building cash and we think the opportunity is right, I think that the Board would agree that we would be in a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]position to buy back some of our stock. You [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]W[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]e [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]saw a little bit of that in the third quarter,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ] when the stock price went down. And so, it -- I think that I wouldn't be surprised to see that sort of thing in the future.
Scott Farmer: Well, let me start by saying that things like the hand sanitizer and some of the sanitation products and wipes that we have fit into a recurring revenue stream,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ] once we put this like the restroom supplies, once we put the stand out there,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ] we come in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ]an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]d[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]service and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ]it [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]on a regular basis, make sure they have enough product in there to make it through till their next delivery and so forth. So that is -- that becomes part of the recurring revenue stream. The other products, things like disposable gloves, disposable face masks,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] and things like that are the one-time PPE sale, I[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] refer to it as one time, but it's more of a direct sale that it can fluctuate up and down depending on customer needs. But we have -- a lot of it depends on geography, it depends on the industry that the customer is in, some distribution-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021  ]type businesses they've increased headcount, increased number of wares, we -- other businesses have reduced the number of wares. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] it's a little bit all over the board trying to put some parameter on that relative to historical average.[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ],[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021  ] I'd say recurring revenue with the understanding that some of that is now the result of hand sanitizer and that's where it is flat through the quarter. And we think that that revenue is going to pick up as the economy turns around, as our customers get back to being able to open their businesses more fully,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ] bring back some of their headcount, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021  ]I believe that an awful lot of the recurring business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ] like hand sanitizer is here to stay. I have said in the past,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ] and I continue to believe that it's going to be a long time before a typical American walks into a business, walks into a restaurant, a lobby, a movie theate[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ]re[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021  ], any place and he isn't looking for a hand sanitizer station after they grabbed the doorknob going in and out of a public building. We're seeing that in stadiums, we're seeing that at -- in hotels that are open, at elevator stations, and that sort of thing[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ].[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ]that's where[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021  ] I think that's going to be here to stay. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ] if I'm right about that, as they bring back and open up their operations more fully, that will be revenue,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021  ] as they add people back on revenue on top of where they are right now.
Scott Farmer: Well, Gary, I think the -- probably the best way to describe it is, as we mentioned, in total for the company, it was up $45 million sequentially. We don't think that will repeat, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021  ]we do believe that these elevated levels, relatively elevated levels are here to stay.
Scott Farmer: Well, I guess, the easiest way to look at it would be that there was a dip from early December into January, and then revenue started to rebound as we got into February. February was better than January. And obviously, if you look at all that,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:58:00 2021 ] the quarter winds up being flat sequentially to the second quarter. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:58:00 2021 ] you can run that down and then dip back up. I would tell you that we do have some momentum as we go into the fourth quarter. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ] we’re -- we have a better expectation of economic conditions and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021  ]in our business as we get into and through the fourth quarter.
Scott Farmer: So, Kevin, I think your question was what percent of our customers are on hold? So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:00:00 2021 ] we have, we had a -- as Mike mentioned, I believe,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ] a strong run up in the summer and into the fall, [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]some never came back, some of them went on hold. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ] it's a little difficult to give me [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]you [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]an exact number on that. But I can tell you th[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]at[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]his, [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]we're anxious for those folks to get back. We think that there is an incredible amount of pent up demand that is in the marketplace, you had that with stimulus checks, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:02:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:02:00 2021  ]we think consumer spending could spike quite strongly in the Q3, Q4 calendar years -- of the calendar year. And we think that'll be really positive. If you put that together with the strong value proposition that we have increasingly, the strong value proposition that we have with our customers, meaning that when they come back, they still have to provide confidence to their employees and their customers, their clients, that they're coming back to a safe environment. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021 ] we think all that combined is going to make for a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ]quite a good situation.
Scott Farmer: To begin with, most of those -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]the revenue from those customers is in our direct sale business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]a[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]nd [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]that business is down about 40% over prior year, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]. [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]An[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]d [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]as you analyze that, it's a little different depending on which segment you're talking about. For example, a lot of cruise ships are still at port, so the cruise line business has really been affected. There is some travel happening now,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ] particularly sort of vacation travel. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ] the hotels are doing a little bit better, the airlines are starting to pick up. When I say that, I mean they are [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ]their [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021  ]revenue streams to -- within their own business. We had seen a little bit of improvement from our revenue to those customers. And -- but still down 40% is a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ]pretty significant number, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]I think that the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]those businesses will have some form of recovery as the vaccines continue to roll out and people begin to feel safer travell[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]ing. I haven't been to the vacation spots in Florida, but I understand that the spring break crowd is maybe not as big as normal, but they're down there right now. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ] I think there was a -- as Todd said, a pent up demand for people to be able to go and do things again, vacation again, go get on an [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]airplane and go visit family in a different state across the country, that sort of thing. And I think that the big, the big[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ] trigger for all that and when that all happens is how soon a good portion of the U.S population has a vaccine. How long would [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021  ]will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]it take to get back to pre-COVID? That I don't know, it[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ] might take a couple of years, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021  ]I definitely could see that there would be some improvement in the second half of the year if the pace of vaccines continues at the rate that it is right now.
Gary Bisbee: Hey, guys, good morning. It's impressive to get back to flat year-over-year same day sales, I guess, a quarter really before lapping the step down from the pandemic. I wanted to ask about mix within that sale. So, can you give us a sense of how meaningful PP&E sanitizers and other pandemic driven sales are to the current revenue levels? And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:27:00 2021 ] how much the more normal historical mix would still be down, right in Q3 without that? That's the first question.
Gary Bisbee: And if I could just clarify one thing in that response. Scott, you said recurring revenues were flat. Did you mean sequentially versus Q2 or did you mean year-over-year? And if the latter, flat year-over-year, does that imply then that the one-time-ish PP&E sales increase year-over-year was similar to the Uniform Direct sales decrease, which would allow that to be flat? I just want to make sure I understood[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:37:00 2021 ]understand[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:37:00 2021  ] exactly what you're saying.
Gary Bisbee: Got it? Okay. All right. I mean, what I'm trying to solve for is, how much the traditional businesses are down. I appreciate everything you're saying about this demand persists in the big uptick [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]uptake and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021  ]in sustainable recurring sanitizer sales, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021  ]in the traditional pre-pandemic business mix, I mean, is that still down 5% and it's offset by PP&E up 5% or directionally, can you help us understand it? What I'm really trying to solve[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ][[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]solve [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021  ]for is what's at risk of going away over 12 months, 18 months, as the traditional business mix obviously comes roaring back.
