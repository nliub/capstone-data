William C. Gale: Good evening. Thank you for joining us as we report our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2013. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1,129,000,000, which represents record quarterly revenue for Cintas and growth of 7.2% from last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, was 6.2%. Our operating income was $153.9 million, which is 13.6% of revenue, an improvement over the 13.4% in last year's fourth quarter. This operating margin improvement comes despite adding route capacity during the past 3 quarters, material cost headwinds due to a high volume of new business sold during the fiscal year and a reduction in recycled paper prices of about $10 per ton during the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter net income increased by 9.4% to $86 million. Earnings per diluted share were $0.69, a 15% increase over last year's fourth quarter EPS of $0.60. Our EPS growth rate was higher than our net income growth rate because of the positive impact of our share buyback program. We purchased roughly $338 million of Cintas stock in the last 15 months, which certainly had a positive impact on our EPS growth rate. During the fourth quarter of fiscal '13, we purchased about $28 million of Cintas stock, which brought our fiscal year 2013 purchases to roughly $208 million. As of May 31, we had about $162 million available under the current board authorization for future share purchases. May 31 marked the conclusion of a very successful year at Cintas, one in which we achieved both record sales and earnings per share levels. Fiscal '13 revenue topped $4.3 billion, and earnings per share grew 11% to $2.52. This was the third consecutive fiscal year of double-digit earnings per share growth. In fact, our EPS grew 80% in that 3-year period. Operating income for fiscal 2013 grew by 4.7% over last year to $565 million. This operating income increase came despite a negative year-over-year recycled paper price impact in excess of $13 million. This resulted in a drag on operating margin of 30 basis points. In addition, operating income increased despite the addition of route capacity during the final 3 quarters of the fiscal year. This route capacity was necessary due to the solid new business sales during the last few years. Our employees, who we call partners, continue to do a great job of executing our game plan in order to achieve these record fiscal 2013 results. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the fourth quarter, after which, I will provide additional comments on our fiscal 2014 guidance.
William C. Gale: Thanks, Mike. Our fiscal 2014 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.5 million to $4.6 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.66 to $2.75. Let me provide some color and walk through a few assumptions so you can better understand the guidance. As Mike mentioned, our fiscal 2014 year will have 1 less workday than fiscal 2013. This will have a negative impact on fiscal '14's revenue growth as well as EPS. Fiscal '13 also had 1 less workday than the previous year, and this had a negative 40 basis point impact on fiscal '13's revenue growth rate. The negative EPS impact of 1 less workday is due to a number of our large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization, being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. One less work day results in 1 less day of revenue to cover these expenses. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release, the U.S. economy has shown some signs of improvement in the past several months. However, much uncertainty and unevenness remains. Just last week, a number of economists lowered their second quarter GDP forecast to below 1.5%, with softer second half 2013 forecasts as well. Evidence of this uncertainty continues to show itself by our customers' reluctance to hire. Our net add-stops metric was negative in the fourth quarter and worse than the fourth quarter of the previous 2 years. It is true that overall U.S. employment figures have strengthened in the past several months. However, 2/3 of the job gains in the past 4 months have been in industries not typically strong for our rental programs: financial and information services; professional and business services, including temporary employees; education and food service. We certainly hope to see broader strengthening in employment in the coming months, but we have not seen it yet. We have modeled our fiscal '14 guidance with the expectation that this current uncertain economic climate will remain. We have not assumed any deterioration in the U.S. economy. There are a number of factors causing the current uncertain environment in the U.S. economy: future Federal Reserve action and its impact on the interest rate environment; the impact of worsening economies in Europe and China, to name a few. The Affordable Care Act is certainly one of those factors, and it has a direct impact on our cost structure. The Affordable Care Act includes new costs such as the transitional reinsurance fee, which is scheduled to begin in 2014 and other associated administrative and reporting expenses. As a result, we expect fiscal 2014 medical expenses as a percent of revenue to be higher than fiscal 2013 by 10 to 30 basis points. Note that while we do have available capacity under our current share buyback program, we have not considered any additional buybacks in the fiscal '14 guidance. One final comment on the fiscal '14 expectations. We expect the year-over-year comparisons for our first quarter to be very difficult for 3 reasons. First, the first quarter has 1 less workday in it than last year's first quarter. This will have a negative impact on both the revenue growth rate and operating margins, particularly in the rental segment. Secondly, current recycled paper prices are roughly $45 per ton, lower than last year's first quarter average. This will create a negative $3 million to $5 million year-over-year impact on our Document Management segment's first quarter revenue and operating income. And finally, we started adding route capacity in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. As a result, last year's first quarter had the highest gross margin of the fiscal 2013 year. While these added routes will help us continue to grow revenues, route efficiency is certainly affected, especially compared to last year's first quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions.
William C. Gale: Well, I would say there are several things that would push us to the higher end of the range. One would be a pickup in our adds over stops, resulting in more revenue per stop in our rental business due to maybe new hires or I guess existing customers adding on new hires or services. Another opportunity to get to the higher end would be higher paper prices than what we may be anticipating. A third thing could be that maybe we are being a little too conservative on the impact of the Affordable Care Act. Third thing could be -- or fourth thing could be lower energy prices. I think there's a lot of speculation of what may happen with energy prices. We presume that energy prices in '14 will be comparable to what we saw in '13, which, in the fourth quarter, were about 3.2% of revenue.
William C. Gale: Yes, we're expecting $240 million to $260 million, Andrew. And as Mike mentioned in his comments, this is up from what we've seen in the last couple of years, one, due to continuation of the rollout of our enterprise resource filing software and -- but secondly, we're at -- we're going to be -- we're anticipating the need to build some rental capacity in some selected markets. So that guidance assumes the opening of some new rental capacity.
William C. Gale: Depends on what happens with the revenue growth. If revenue accelerates, then we may be looking at some more rental capacity.
William C. Gale: Well, January 1 is when these expenses come. So just because of the recent change, as we understand it, in businesses not having to provide health insurance doesn't impact those companies that are continuing to provide health insurance, and that we are going to have to start paying these additional taxes and fees associated with the Affordable Care Act. So that, as far as we've been able to ascertain, is still in place. The other thing that we are anticipating is that due to the uncertainty surrounding exchanges, due to the fact that many employers might drop coverage, we don't know what's going to happen, we think the participation rate on the part of our employee base may increase either by employees themselves coming on because maybe they've been covered under their spouse coverage or not carrying insurance at all, or may be now they'll convert their family coverage over to Cintas' plan for maybe what their spouse's plan has been. So all of those factors go into effect and therefore, we think that the increases will start in the last 5 months of our fiscal year, which will begin January 1.
William C. Gale: They're actually in existing markets where we're currently at. And I would tell you, it's not due to the fact that we eliminated capacity necessarily, but rather that we have been growing in those markets at a rate that we are just bursting at the seams and needing to build capacity.
William C. Gale: Well, I -- you asked a lot there. I think generally, our guidance is assuming we'll continue to see the very good results in new business from new customers, primarily no-programmers or the majority, which are no-programmers, but as well as some competitive wins. So again, higher cost initially with that kind of growth; obviously, some additional pressure on capacity, et cetera. So that's what's assumed in our guidance. We are continuing to do some penetration of other products and services with customers -- with existing customers, and we'll continue to focus on that, things like chemical dispensing and some of the facility services product -- products. But when you really look through the impact of where the growth is coming from in rental, it's primarily driven by new customer wins, and that's what our assumption is continuing to go forward. It's what we've seen through the last couple of years, really.
William C. Gale: Very, very competitive. It is no different than what it's been for the last couple of years. And I would tell you, we are seeing some competition on no-programmers because some of our big competitors have actually started doing the same approach and often, a customer can be fairly sophisticated, and they may bring in another supplier. So it is, certainly, still a competitive situation.
William C. Gale: We have seen improvement. Our rental management made a concerted effort to really improve our lost [ph] business rates, and I think they've done a nice job and that. The trend is going in the right direction, focusing on service as well as some of the additional products that we have. So it has improved from the prior year or 2.
William C. Gale: Well, I would say that the big rollouts began, Andrew, in primarily the third quarter and continued through the fourth. I don't see a repeat of those big rollouts, but we won't really see -- we're working on new ones obviously, but our guidance doesn't assume any big rollouts in '14, but rather kind of a status quo of the revenues that we saw in '13.
William C. Gale: I don't -- we really don't get into specific quarters. I'd just tell you, for the year, it's just a modest growth in the direct sale business.
William C. Gale: Well, it hasn't -- our desire really hasn't changed much. We want to use the cash, number one, to grow the business through additional capacity and other needs that we have. Secondly, we'd love to make good acquisitions. But as you can see from the results, we didn't make a whole lot of acquisitions during the year, but I'd say that's due to a -- not a lack of desire on our part, but rather a lack of good opportunities, so we continue to stay disciplined. You -- certainly, the past 30 years have shown that we continue to increase the dividend every year, and that decision will be made later this calendar year by the board. And then the share buybacks, we still have money left under the current authorization, and we've got a lot of cash sitting there. And obviously, we will follow the direction of the board to execute on that buyback as conditions warrant.
William C. Gale: I really can't comment on that, Andrew, because the board will discuss that at their future meetings. But certainly, history tends to be an indication of the future, so I would say it should increase.
William C. Gale: Well, I'm concerned on both parts. But to me, the economy and what the impact of this thing could have on the attitude of businesses to hire employees is probably more of a long-term concern to me than anything else. And I think that there is a tremendous amount of concern on the part of many businesses of what this could do to them, even though there may have been some rule changes that businesses don't have to necessarily provide health insurance next year if they have over 50 employees. Those companies that do have over 50 employees realize that the cost of providing that insurance to every employee is going to go up, just like we're anticipating it's going to go up. And then, of course, the issue is what happens in '15 when these rules get reinstated as far as businesses. So John, there's so much uncertainty out there that I think businesses are -- don't like uncertainty. And as a result of that, I think they're being cautious. But it's not just the Affordable Care Act. As I mentioned in the comments, what's the Fed going to do? What interest -- what's going to happen with interest rates? What's going to happen in China? How's the European economy going to impact us? All of that stuff is weighing on people's decision of how much they should invest and that has impact, ultimately, on us and how fast and how much more we can grow. So I think we've done a pretty darn good job as a company over the last few years adapting to this environment. Sure, we'd like faster growth from our existing customers, but it hasn't been there. So we've been able to go out and get new business, and hopefully, we've got a lot of pent-up demand that ultimately will generate additional business for us as confidence builds.
William C. Gale: I don't see a lot of that going on. We did partner with that one retailer. It hasn't really been any significant part of our business. And at this point, I don't really see too much expansion of that.
William C. Gale: Yes, we were a little surprised at that too, Shlomo. It happened shortly after we announced our earnings back in March, so we had seen a tick-up late in the third quarter, and then we got into kind of the spring and it kind of turned the other way on us. And it was interesting how one of other -- our other national competitors saw the same thing happened with their business that they announced a couple of weeks ago.
William C. Gale: That's what we're -- yes, it's certainly not an individual thing for our customers. It's more of a macro thing.
William C. Gale: Well, we have a plan at the beginning of the year, but then we have to adjust it for reality as we go through the year. And I would say based on what we saw happening through the year, we pretty much finished in line.
William C. Gale: Again, if I take the plan as it may, I thought it might be a year ago, I would say we finished under that plan. But as we went through the year, we adjusted to reality and we finished in line with our expectations.
William C. Gale: We got a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter from inventory reduction due to the fact we had built up some inventory for some of these direct sale rollouts, and we then dissipated that inventory as we roll those out. So I don't think you'll see a repeat of that. Everything else should be in line, though. So there'll be -- probably a minor increase, a relatively minor increase in inventory levels as we go through '14, which, obviously, would have the offset effect that we saw in the fourth quarter.
William C. Gale: Well, first, I want to credit our management team in the first aid group. I think they've really done a nice job and the sales team also. But what it has been, Shlomo, is the fact that we've now got more of a national footprint, and we're able to provide these First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services to national customers. So we're focusing on some of that, and that's increased the growth. The other thing that they -- that the business unit has done is expanded their product offerings, especially in things like training. And that has been very, very well received in the marketplace. So I think it's a combination of the national footprint's there. Therefore, we can provide coverage to a lot of national customers, and we've got a pretty broad offering of products and services within that group that are very appealing to helping companies maintain compliance with laws and regulations.
William C. Gale: Yes, I think so. I think it's a double-digit, low teens type growth rate in an economy like we've seen.
William C. Gale: It's comparable to what we saw late in the fourth quarter, Dan, and all that was factored into the guidance that we provided. We still are very bullish on the new business and therefore, we still anticipate that the rental segment will grow organically in fiscal '14.
William C. Gale: We've seen some benefits in a couple of the early conversions, obviously, in the finance group and the Global Supply Chain group. We've seen some of the benefits we were anticipating. It's still too soon to see them as we're rolling it out into our first venture in any of our business groups. We've had a few hiccups, but nothing serious. But I would say right now, we are continuing to expect to roll it out company-wide, but we want to make sure that we're successful in the initial business rollout first.
William C. Gale: Pretty much run for profit, improve margins, generate cash. Right now, it's doing reasonably well. It's not growing a lot, but that's by design. And we are continuing to take some of the marketing and operating ideas that we have done here in the States, have been successful and applying them over in Europe with some degree of success. So I would say that it's kind of let's prove out that what we've invested in made sense and it can generate the kind of profits and cash flow that we originally anticipated.
William C. Gale: Well Rental will be the biggest part. It's 70% of the revenue, and it's a major capital user with the equipment facilities and trucks. The next biggest area, of course, is Document Management, and they would be the next highest percentage of capital. We will really break down our CapEx expectations by business unit. We'll report what it actually was after the fact, but that will give you some idea where it's going to.
William C. Gale: We're primarily, at this point, focused more on acquisitions that would be additive towards our existing segments. I don't see us, at this point, really aggressively going after a new leg of the stool in the next year or 2.
William C. Gale: No, a lot -- geographic is part of it, but it's probably more tuck-in, where we can buy a facility or a business in an area that we're already in and combine that with our existing operations.
William C. Gale: I just want to thank everyone for joining us. I know it's a very busy time with earnings season, and we're off-cycle, but this is the one that always fits in with everybody, all the calendar year companies. So thank you for the attendance. I hope everyone has a good rest of the summer, and we'll speak with you in the latter part of September as we report first quarter results.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, as I mentioned, Joe, there was no difference between the total growth and the organic growth in the rental business in our fourth quarter, and we haven't factored in any rental acquisitions in that guidance.
J. Michael Hansen: Well, in the third quarter, we talked about that it was at the -- we've seen medical expenses be in the 3% to 4% of revenue range. And our third quarter, we were at the top of that range or the higher end of that range. So the fourth quarter was kind of a, certainly, a reduction from the third quarter levels that we saw. For the year, we were kind of in that mid-3% range.
J. Michael Hansen: Yes, with the real large rollouts in the second half of the year, our fiscal '14 Uniform Direct Sale is going to have a hard time growing much over those large amounts. Generally, we like to see that Uniform Direct Sales number, over time, grow in the mid-single digits, and it's continued to do that even though it is pretty lumpy. But I would say, again, I'd say that we've got a little bit better comps in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, it's going to be tough to see much growth.
J. Michael Hansen: The actual prices in fiscal '13 first quarter were $170; second quarter, $150; third quarter, $140; fourth quarter, $140.
J. Michael Hansen: I'll give you -- sometimes, we'll talk about the growth without recycling, and our organic growth in the fourth quarter without recycling was 8.9%. That is a nice increase over the 7.1% in the third quarter, and we've seen steady improvement in that organic growth rate without the recycling for the last 5 quarters. So after the shocks of the up and downs of paper, now that paper has kind of steadied out over the last 3 quarters, we've seen some real nice organic growth improvement in the business.
J. Michael Hansen: We have purchased $200 -- almost $208 million during the fiscal year, which was a 5-point -- just under 5.1 million shares. There's a little bit of a difference on the balance sheet between the two -- from the $208 million because we do buy back some shares related to our equity compensation program and stock option exercises. So there's a little bit of a difference there.
J. Michael Hansen: Well, as you -- as we mentioned, we started to add route capacity in our second quarter and continued to do that into the third and fourth quarters. As we move into '14, we will -- because of the new business performance, we'll likely continue to add routes, probably a little bit less and a little bit more strategic than in fiscal '13. So probably not quite as many coming in the next year as we did in fiscal '13.
J. Michael Hansen: Really has to do with where -- if we can find a tuck-in opportunity at a good value, we certainly love those kind of acquisition opportunities, and that can happen wherever we have current operations.
