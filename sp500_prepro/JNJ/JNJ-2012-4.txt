Louise Mehrotra: We also look, obviously, at the future pipeline. Could we, in fact, and did we see a path forward to be able to be in a more competitive position. And three, how did we see it fitting in a more complementary way with some of our other businesses.  And while we certainly believe in the future of diagnostics, we think that that will more likely be in an area outside of clinical diagnostics such as molecular diagnostics, biomarkers, some of the other things that we’re already working on with some of our oncology programs.  So when we looked at that in total, we felt that stepping back and looking at broader strategic options for that business was, in fact, the best thing to do for that business longer term, as well as for more broadly across Johnson & Johnson.  And I also just think it’s indicative of the need for us to continue to look for ways, again, to make a better difference for patients and to drive growth in our organization. Now, to your second question, if I look more broadly across consumer, I’d start by saying that we remain very committed and excited about the future of our consumer group. It’s been essential to J&J for many, many years, and as we look to the future, there’s a couple of aspects that I think are very important. One, and something that we’ve been extremely consistent about over the past several years, is returning and repairing some of the quality and supply issues that we’ve had in our OTC, particularly in the McNeil U.S. division.  I’m very pleased with the progress that we’re making in that. We mentioned to you that the consent decree that we had designed in conjunction with the FDA was approved and reviewed in October, with very few comments. And given the breadth and scale of that agreement, we felt very good about that. We’ve had teams working hard since then. We’ve achieved all of our major milestones since we’ve submitted that agreement.  And very importantly, we’re starting to see some of that pay off in the marketplace. So over the past six months, we’ve seen the reentry of things like Children’s Tylenol, Children’s Motrin. And what we’re particularly pleased about is that if you look at some of the consumer ratings, the quality of those brands, we’ve seen them be remarkably resilient through this period. And when we get them back to the market, we see an uptake occur.  So we’re cautiously optimistic. Our plan through 2013 continues with this driving performance, consistent with the consent decree. We would expect that over the course of 2013 to return about 75% of the brands to the marketplace.  And of course as we do that, we will also begin shifting our focus, not only from making sure that we can have a consistent and reliable supply of that product, but also that we can truly relaunch, working with our trade partners, working with our great marketing teams, to reestablish those brands and their leadership positions in the market. And we’ll do that as the brands reenter over the course of 2013.  And let me just make one other comment. We are also very pleased to see, particularly in the fourth quarter, the upper respiratory strong performance of our consumer brands. So we believe that we continue to have a lot of skills and capabilities that are going to be important for us to continue to build on going forward. Now, outside of the OTC business, I think there’s a lot of other reasons to be optimistic. And granted, as we looked at the results, we’d be the first ones to say while we’re pleased in some areas, we’re not satisfied, and we know we need to do a better job across the portfolio.  Also, some of the results were impacted by the divestitures and portfolio decisions that we made in our consumer group. But when we look at some of the core areas, such as skincare, our Neutrogena business, and some of the things that they have in cytomimic, wrinkle reduction, other technologies, really science-based technologies, and what we think we can do there.  If you take a look at things like oral care, where we’ve driven strong growth, great opportunity to build on that brand Listerine in a global fashion. When we look to an opportunity to expand and grow our business globally, particularly in emerging market - and we admit we’ve seen some setbacks in China due to some of the ingredient issues - but our teams have addressed that of the past year, and we’re confident that we have a path forward.  And finally, and last but certainly not least, our Johnson’s Baby line, which is really an iconic brand, that we still know has a lot of potential. We see it as an important driver of growth in the future.  And I think for 2013, to be clear, our projections are very consistent with many of yours. But beyond that, our consumer group remains a very important strategic driver at Johnson & Johnson. 
Louise Mehrotra: By the time all those products get back on the shelf, the MD&D business will do better in 2013 than in ’12. And the growth rate in the pharma business, of course in ’12, was dramatically fueled by the launch of the new products that came into the market, so the growth rate in ’12 versus ’11 is impacted by that, and we don’t have that same phenomenon in ’13 over ’12.  Those products continue to do well, but relatively speaking, compared to the two years, the growth rate in pharma would be not as dramatic as the growth rate we saw in ’12 over ’11. You asked about why the conservatism, and look, it’s early. You know, it’s January 22. So we’ll keep you posted throughout the year.

And I look forward to updating you on our progress against them as we move through the year. So I’d like to say, thank you again, and turn it back over to Louise.

But beyond that, our consumer group remains a very important strategic driver at Johnson & Johnson. 
Alex Gorsky: Larry, thanks for the question. What I would say is if we look at the U.S. business, particularly in the back end of the year, as you noted I think it started strong with our pharmaceutical business. We saw very strong performance, and particularly in our launch brands: XARELTO, ZYTIGA, with some of the new indication information, data that was being released. But really across that portfolio, even the immunology as well. Very strong performance. As we look at MD&D, we did have some challenges in certain areas of our business. I think it’s important to acknowledge that. Some of them due competitively. Some of them due to some disruptions in supply. But I would characterize those as, I think, more event-driven versus systemic in nature. And I think you’ll hear later today from Gary and Michel and Karen about their pipeline, about their competitiveness, about some of the very innovative programs they’re driving, that you’ll walk away confident with the plans that they have in place.  And just a couple of things I would note there. One was we’re really starting to see a pickup in our vision care business. For example, in the fourth quarter this year, as you heard, 6% and 7% growth respectively. We’ve got a very exciting portfolio there, and so we’re excited about opportunity. And as I just mentioned a couple of minutes ago, in Synthes in particular, in core hip and knee business, we also saw some strong performance.  And remember, offsetting that in orthopedics, in Synthes, we did have the nail recall in trauma, which was, again, more event-specific than, I think, longer term. And I really think that the DePuy Synthes team has done a great job in managing that. In fact, by later in the quarter, very early in January, we had product back in the operating rooms, and we’re real confident in our ability in managing that going forward. Now, if I look at consumer, there were some areas of softness that, again, we think were more related to some regulatory actions earlier in the year related to our Skillman facility. But if we look more broadly, and we look at things like our OTC performance - and again, this was a business that’s been under a significant amount of pressure, in a very competitive category. And to drive the kind of growth they did in upper respiratory, we’re really proud of that team. And oral care, also, turned in a strong performance as well. So as Dominic just mentioned, we look at all of these markets right now, given the macroeconomic issues, and we have to be realistic. But nonetheless, I think overall the trends that we mentioned we think are manageable, and you’ll see that as performance grows in 2013.
Alex Gorsky: Thank you for the thoughtful question. I think we’ve been fairly consistent in the way we’ve articulated our strategy around M&A. You know, first really starting with where is there unmet need where we feel we should or can be a part of the solution. And that can start with great technologies, that can start with great companies, and there are examples of both that we’ve had historically, that resulted in us going out and acquiring something new. I think more and more we’re looking at the second aspect, of how does it fit in a complementary way with our other businesses, as part of making a broader offering, similar to what we’re seeing now in Synthes, and our vision. And so we’re always looking for businesses that can complement, just don’t replicate, but truly complement and synergize, with some of our existing businesses or some of our platforms. I think the other area that we’re also acutely aware of is how do we drive additional growth globally, particularly in emerging markets. And we’ve done that, I believe, in a disciplined and selective way so far. And I mentioned the recent acquisition we did in China to expand our biologics platform.  But here we’re very excited about the patient and the business opportunity represented by our biosurgical franchise. And it’s another example of where we started with a product, a technology, and we’re building an entire platform to reshape the way that the bleeding is controlled.  And an important component of that is not only to do that in developed markets, but how do we do that in developing markets? How do we source the right kind of capabilities? So by doing this in China, we think that’s going to give us a great opportunity. We’ve done it in our consumer group, with some of the products I mentioned in Russia, Dr. Mom.  So that’s an area where we realize that if we only rely on endogenous growth in some of those markets, we won’t accelerate at the rate that we’re hoping for. That being said, we need to be very thoughtful about which companies, and how we go about it, in some of those markets. Those are a few examples of, I think, areas of interest for us.
Alex Gorsky: Look, our approach all along has been that it’s very important to make sure that as we work our way through healthcare reform, that we stay focused on solutions that do improve or provide access for people who are either un- or under-insured in this country. And we think it’s unacceptable there’s such a high number, and so we’ve tried to work very closely with our trade organizations, with governments, to make sure that patients can get access. So we think that’s important, number one. Number two, specifically as it relates to dual eligibles, we try to work with our trade partners at pharma, with the government, in good faith, toward the additional ACA, and we think that by and large, that program run, Medicare Part D, has been very successful. And we just need to be aware that as we make commitments, as we create programs, that we do so in a way that leads to a consistent approach, and number two, that ensures we continue to reward innovation.  Because if we don’t reward innovation, we’re not going to have the next ZYTIGA, we’re not going to have the next ibrutnib, and some of these wonderful compounds. And by only focusing on costs, we will not cure Alzheimer’s, we will not take care of diabetes in the way that we should. And so that’s why we’re very anxious to work with a lot of other partners on coming up with the way that we’re preserving this underlying encouragement and motivator for innovation, and that’s something that we’re working on.
