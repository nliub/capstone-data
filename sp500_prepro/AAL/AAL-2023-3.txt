Robert Isom: Thanks, Devin. We're incredibly proud of everything the American Airlines team has accomplished over the past 18 months. We told you we were going to focus on reliability, profitability, and strengthening our balance sheet, and we've done just that. American had a great summer and has run the most reliable operation of the U.S. network carriers over the past 15-months. We're consistently profitable and we've materially improved our balance sheet by reducing total debt by nearly $11 billion since 2021. We'll maintain that focus as we move through the fourth quarter and beyond. No matter the macroeconomic conditions we face or the variability of the operating environment, our team is intent on controlling what we can control over the short-term and setting our company up for success over the long run. I'm incredibly excited by what the future holds for American. Looking ahead, we will be much more efficient as an airline. As an example, even today, we could be flying 5% more with the aircraft we already have in our fleet. We're eager to restore regional service to the underserved smaller markets that are still feeling the effects of the pandemic. We're building back and expanding our network in an efficient manner that will lead to stronger revenue production. Our Travel Rewards Program AAdvantage has already undergone significant change that is helping us grow high margin revenue at a greater rate than GDP and we anticipate that to continue as we work to make our co-brand credit cards even more valuable to consumers and our partners. On top of all that, we continue to innovate in creating a leading retailing experience, ensuring that anything we offer our customers can be shopped, purchased, and serviced digitally. It all bodes well for American, our team members, customers, the communities we serve, and especially our investors as we enter 2024 and look to 2025 and beyond. And with that, operator, please open the line for analyst questions.
Robert Isom: Hey, and David, I just want to add one thing to that. It's look, we're going to be part of and also a driver of premium revenue growth. So one of the things I think is noteworthy, our premium seeding is going to grow by 43% between now and 2026. And that's as a result of bringing on the new XLR and reconfiguring our 777 300s and actually taking a look at even some of the domestic fleet as well, where I know that we'll be adding more first-class product, or at least reconfiguring to that end. And on that same front, we're really pleased with our regional aircraft. On that front, you take a look at the E175 and they have fantastic cabins that are every bid is nice and appreciated by customers is anything we fly in the mainline side. So I look forward to participating in driving what's going to be going on in terms of premium products.
Robert Isom: Hey, thanks for the question Catie. We do have it's largely timing and operational performance with higher ASMs is what benefited us in the third quarter. In our prior guidance, we didn't have anything in the third quarter for our open labor agreements outside of the pilots. We did have something in the fourth quarter and we still have something modest in the fourth quarter just given the time it would take to reach and ratify an agreement. But generally speaking, everything this year has come in very much in line with what our initial guidance was, which is why for the full-year, we're still right around that 3% number. We've seen a little bit of pressure on certain line items. We've gotten some benefits from others, but overall it's largely in line with our expectations. And like just generally speaking, we are pretty good at forecasting out expenses. And I think during the COVID years, that became a little bit more challenging. But in 2023, we feel pretty good about our ability to forecast and deliver results.
Robert Isom: Sure. I will do my best. There's a few things that are changing in our system right now between one quarter to the next that has that effect. In Q3, what we find just in terms of how we brought the network back, a lot of what we were flying were off time periods, like off peak flights. As we get into Q4, that starts to stabilize a little bit more. We regain a lot more regional supportability into the fourth quarter. And so a little bit of what you see there are just shifting year-over-year trends based on how we brought the airline back and then where the airline is oriented around flying. In the third quarter, especially in the trough seasons of August and September, there are some strange year-over-year comps where the Northeast was performing better than markets in the Sunbelt, when we get into Q4, that's when the Sunbelt and short haul MCLA starts to change. And you see that in our schedules. We have, I think, our biggest Miami operation in our history there. So a lot of what you see there is less a function of something fundamental, but some really unique quarter-to-quarter recovery trends.
Robert Isom: Hey, thanks for the question. Look, and the answer is both very simple and consistent with the stuff we've been saying. What we get to do is, the stuff we have to do is within our control. It's bringing back our regional jet network, which creates a lot of revenue benefits for us and a lot of unique markets for our customers. And two, it's growing the revenues from AAdvantage, both through our brand of credit cards and how we go issue and enable the redemption of miles. Both of those things are tops on our plans for next year. We're excited to go and execute on that. And we see a lot of upside.
Robert Isom: No, no, I'll start, Conor and Vasu can join in. Look, you know, when we talk about the kind of capacity that we are going to be putting back, we've described it over and over again. I think that, you know, first off, we've got assets that on hand today that provide some of that benefit. We're certainly going to make sure that, that gets deployed in a fashion that is productive. I do think that there are constraints out there that continue on and whether that's ATC or it's some of the supply chain, both engines and air framers, I think that, that kind of stuff is we're going to have to work through. And then on top of that, look, we're all getting through the pilot shortfalls as well. So there's ups and downs to that. But overall, you will see us, we're going to play our game. And that means find our Sunbelt hubs, strengthening the rest of our network through getting capacity back up in the air, and doing all the things that Vasu has talked about in terms of taking advantage of AAdvantage and our co-brand deals and then also modern retailing.
Robert Isom: And Conor, I'll just underscore one more time. Please take a look at the past year. There's a lot of variability in quarters in terms of whose network is aligned to do better one to the next. And also, a lot of noise in the numbers in terms of just building back the airlines from the pandemic. We feel really confident about how we're seeing '24 especially on a competitive basis against our peers.
Robert Isom: Yes. Ali, thanks for that. Look, we work closely with Boeing. And I have to tell you that the Boeing team has been really, really forthcoming and cooperative with us. Certainly, they have some issues with supply chain, and they're working with us on our order book. We probably anticipate seeing a little bit of slippage as we go into next year but it's not something that is going to have a material impact on our capacity, and we're working very closely with Boeing on that. So thanks for that question.
Robert Isom: Yes. And hey David, remind me, for same aircraft type, when we see first officers upgrading from the FO position to capital position, the compensation increases roughly 35%, 40%.
Robert Isom: Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone. I'll close with this. There's obviously a lot of short-term sentiment in thinking out there. And we understand why. There's a lot going on in the world today. That said, the airline business is one that absolutely requires long-term thinking as we navigate -- even as we navigate shorter-term variability. The aircraft we buy today are going to be around for 20-years plus. The leases we signed at airports and the hundreds of millions and billions of dollars that we commit to airports. Those are leases that are 10 years plus in financings that go out a lot longer than that. And even the labor contracts that we sign are multiple years, 4 and 5 years. So we have to take that into account as we look to the future. And all of us at American have worked tirelessly to set the airline up for success in the short term, yet long-term world. So as we look to 2024 and beyond, look, we have an enviable fleet. We've gone out and spent $30 billion prior to the pandemic to put ourselves in a position where we are entering into capital spending that is lasting. And we're doing it in an environment where others are facing rising interest rates and issues with suppliers. So while there's a heading the other way, we're set up for success. And we look forward to putting all of our assets back to full utilization and we know we can optimize how we're running the airline as we go forward. And all of that is why we build the best network and work with our customers to make sure that they are rewarded for using it. So we've got a great baseline, and I'm very confident in the future of travel and demand. And I can't wait to talk to you more as we go out to the next quarter 2024 about where American is headed and the story we have to tell. So thank you very much.
Vasu Raja: Yes, look, just building off of Robert's comments in the opening remarks, as we look forward, we think we have a lot of opportunity there. Our hubs and really all of our hubs, but especially our four of our largest and potentially highest capacity hubs in Phoenix, Dallas, Charlotte, and Miami are located near what are starting to turn out to be some of the most economically resilient markets there are. And we still have opportunity to go bring back more fleet, and we have infrastructure in those places to grow further. And as we see the future unfolding, to your point, Helene, we actually see a lot of opportunities to go and grow the performance of the coastal markets and Philadelphia and Chicago specifically in a way that's really complimentary to that.
Vasu Raja: Yes, Helene, actually it's none of the above would be the answer to the question. Look in the business of ours from one quarter to another, it's easy to draw a lot of prognostications, which probably aren't there. And as we see it right now, it's a particularly weird time. One, because so many -- so much of the U.S. airline business is still recovering their networks, and the networks that are being recovered are probably never been more divergent, never more different competitively, but also never more different than what was there three or four, certainly five years ago. And so a little bit of what you see is that. And what I would actually say is we, I'll echo the points I made and then Robert made me in the opening bit. As we look forward, actually we see a lot of opportunity. First of all, with our network, you know, as we look out there, we serve 300 cities in North America, in 200 of them, we have a network advantage. And as we bring back more of the regional jets, as we up gauge the mainline fleet, that's a real advantage for us, because so many of our competitors really won't be there. The customers in those cities are about 50% of our customer base, but they produce about 60% of our revenues. They're the ones who are signing up for the program for AAdvantage and enrolling in the card. And then the other big opportunity we have really across our enterprise, but it'll play out most notably in the domestic system, is really with AAdvantage, our travel rewards program. As we see it, our co-branded credit card is the largest co-branded credit card in circulation. Our program is one [Technical Difficulty] maybe travel programs in the business. But if you look at us, we produce probably $400 million less in frequent flyer revenue than what the industry leader does right now. So the quarter-to-quarter trends are just a function of things like the recovery. The real thing that we're seeing is the opportunity in the quarters and years ahead.
Vasu Raja: Sure, this is Vasu. I can answer that. In fact, I'd be very, very happy to answer it. Look, what we see, and we think that the real causal thing that's happening in the customer itself as opposed to a their product or cabinet service, what we've certainly seen and Robert alluded to it since 2019 advantage -- our advantage customers are really driving the revenue production of the company, and that's manifesting itself in a range of ways. So versus ‘19, our membership is up 50%. Almost two-thirds of our revenue, certainly in this last quarter, came from AAdvantage customers. And what we're finding with them is that those customers are proving to be a much more resilient pool of demand that indeed are willing to engage in behaviors that aren't just shopping for the fastest schedule or the cheapest price. We see that play out in a lot of different ways. One is premium cabin performance, where our premium fair products revenue is up 7% from AAdvantage customers, in keeping with our overall seed growth. Two, we see that remuneration on our credit cards is of about 25% from these customers. And then importantly, we find that these customers disproportionately want to shop with us directly about 85% of all the AAdvantage member revenue in the system is coming through our direct channels. So we see the causal thing, and that's why it was in our remarks, is what's really happening is for our AAdvantage members, there's a real desire to travel, and they're coming to us because they want a great network and a program that rewards them for using it, delivered reliably over and over and over again.
Vasu Raja: Yes. Hi, thank you Andrew. It’s another question which I don't know if people might have happy to happy to address and that I'll do it in this fashion. We have made a number of changes with our selling and distribution strategy, the purpose of which is very simple. Our customers have been telling us for a very long time now that they want it so that anything that we offer them can be shopped, sold, and serviced digitally. And we've been seeing that customer sentiment for a really long time. And that's what we're out to serve. And our strategy is this simple. In order to go make that happen, we need to distribute our product exclusively through the internet. And that's what you're seeing from us. We're shifting content, bare products, schedules, things like that, out of legacy technology where we can't provide customers the kind of shopping and service experience they expect, and we're putting it through technologies that can. And on that journey, we've certainly invited all of our retailers to come along with it, but that is a different world than what was there before. And what we've seen before is really encouraging, actually. In the quarter, our total business revenues were up 2%. We actually performed better year-over-year among contracted corporations than we had in a number of months prior to it. But very importantly, our cost of sale is down 13%. So we're finding that we're able to generate more revenues through less cost of sale, which is very encouraging to us. And like I said, as we go forward, we intend to continue the momentum that we've got. We certainly invite any retailing partner to join us along the journey. And in fact, most recently, we launched a new business program called AAdvantage Business. And AAdvantage is very much the platform upon which we will build all of our commercial programs. But through that -- through AAdvantage business, companies of all sizes can access our content in a way that's cheaper, simpler, better servicing, and in a way that's more rewarding for travelers. We'll accelerate their status. So we're actually really encouraged by what we've seen, encouraged by its revenue production, and look forward to continuing the momentum.
Vasu Raja: Sorry, Mike. Shame on me. My microphone wasn't on. But I'll repeat, I'll answer the first question first. Indeed, premium cabin revenues are up across our system, about 6% to 7%.
Vasu Raja: By AAdvantage members whose revenue is up about 7%. Non-members are up about 5%. And then to your question [Technical Difficulty] about customer base. Look, one of the things that we've certainly noticed is probably more importantly than segmenting based on fair products is by the customers themselves. And so what we do is we look at customers who are buying non-premium products. Those are fairs that are not eligible for discounts, mileage earn, things like that, are lowest selling products. And we look at it for customers who are non-advantaged customers, who tend to be our most transitory customers. And we find is that transitory customers buying our lowest selling fares is about 30% of our system revenue. The other 70% is customers, who are buying premium quality fares. And that number is disproportionately weighted to advantage customers.
Vasu Raja: Yes. Hey, thanks, Mike. And I'll answer through the lens of New York, which I know is probably on a lot of our investors' minds. And I'll answer the Haneda question as part of it. At the time pre-COVID and certainly prior to the NEA, American Airlines had a really fundamental problem in New York, which is we were losing our relevance to New York city originating customers. Every year we had declining originating share, our AAdvantage enrollments were declining year-after-year, simply because we didn't have a slot portfolio to compete with the two largest ones. And that was the reasons behind doing the NEA. Now in these last several weeks and months, what we've noticed is actually the New York originating customer has changed what they demand. Same day business trips are down a lot. There's way fewer people originating New York, who are looking to take day trips to Boston or Chicago or Detroit. But that New York city customer is much more interested in flying long haul, internationally long haul, to the west coast [Technical Difficulty] market in Florida. That's a thing that our slot portfolio is much more built to do. And in the last few weeks since the NEA has been terminated, actually what we've seen is that our originating share is stable. New York city can be the number one market in our system both for AAdvantage enrollments and for credit card signups and penetration. So we're encouraged by that and you see that. The last thing I'll mention about it is through our global partnerships we're able to offer a thing in New York which is very unique both in our TA facility and also being able to go and operate our major partners -- major complexes whether that's Heathrow or Haneda or Doha for that matter.
Vasu Raja: Hey Jamie, Thanks for the question. I guess, we’ve all been around this business for a while and steady state is always a very difficult thing to prognosticate. But I will say this, the role of these hubs is quite complimentary. And we're seeing it more and more per my comments earlier, where New York is a lot of New York originating customers when it goes international. Domestic, it's a mix of New York originating, and as we call it, Spoke City, like outside of hubs originating into New York. And Philadelphia is our largest connecting complex into transatlantic. And so a lot of what you see is just, it comes back to what Robert mentioned. We're seeing actually a lot of traction in international and transatlantic, better than we have before. We're seeing it from both of these markets. For the first time since our Atlantic joint venture was created, we're pretty consistently the unit revenue leader amongst the group, which has been very unique and a long time coming. And so we think that these two hubs are very complimentary. We see it every day that they're very complimentary as we bring in the XLR that enables us to do some really unique things in both of those markets. And as we do things like improve the configuration on the 777 300 or bring in more 787 9s, that further augments that. So that's what you see and look in the world of network planning, we can move things around based on where the demand is. We'll continue to do it. There will be some of that rebalancing. And certainly as we go into next year, we do see a lot of opportunity to bulk up in Philadelphia as we get more supportability back, as the regional comes back, as we take wide body deliveries.
Vasu Raja: Yes. Hey Savi, this is Vasu. I can take that, and I'll take it in two parts. First, just around the world, yes, we see really strong long-haul revenue trends, regardless of the entity, long-haul Atlantic, long-haul Latin America, long-haul Pacific and as I mentioned earlier, versus any prior period of time, whether last year 2019 or really anything as far back as it goes we've seen uniquely strong revenue performance. But what we're encouraged by is that our revenue performance, though it's not where we yet wish it to be, has never grown at a faster rate than some of our international partners. And for many of them, fly into North America is the very best thing that they do. So we're encouraged by the journey we've been on we see more opportunity ahead as we do simple things. Configure airplanes smartly, get low-cost jets like the XLR. And so our future in international is one which is well within our control and very practical. It doesn't involve any great prognostications of how the world would change. And then as far as next year goes, look, a lot of our overall entity mix is largely to be similar, where we're going to be about a 70%, 75% short-haul carrier and a 20% to 25% long-haul carrier. But those areas would grow at a similar rate, which is why the mix stays on.
Vasu Raja: Hey Dan, I appreciate the question, and I'll do that be your answer sequentially, too. Look, first and foremost, like I said, we're very encouraged by the changes that we've got there, largely, because they're simply responsive to the customers. And we're retailing our product the way customers expect, which is really just through the Internet. And unsurprisingly, customers have responded. So what we saw as we were going through COVID, was already without American Airlines making any strategic changes, we went from about selling 50% direct to selling about 60% direct and right now, what we're in taking in terms of revenue is actually about 80% going through, as we call it, Internet-based distribution, of which about 70 of those 80 points is going through our true direct channels .com and app and the balance coming through new distribution technologies. In fact, our Internet-based travel agency technologies is now a bigger source of bookings than any of the legacy global distribution systems are. So we're encouraged by that, but also very clearly not that surprised. I mean customers want that experience, which is the second part of your question. The very simple benefit is through what we do, we can go and create more offers for customers that they value. We've seen this, and we continue to see this at a number of customers who come to aa.com or the app shopping for the cheapest fare that we have end up selling up, like roughly 70% of the customers who come to our websites actually come looking for the lowest fare, but buy something higher than that. And through these new tools, we can go and offer them a whole lot more that creates value for them. We can differentiate things like how they're able to redeem miles for different fare products or even they're able to earn miles for different fair products. And then the other thing that I would say is, which is we're finding to be very, very impactful. And as we shift to Internet-based distribution, our servicing becomes a whole lot simpler. So it's hard to do what three years out look like. Looks like, but I can talk about the next several weeks and quarters. And what you will see from us are things where we do much more consciously differentiate. All the content we offer will be through Internet-based technologies. We will look to do things like offering more miles for buying premium cabin for shopping through our direct channels for using our credit card. We will create more redemption opportunities for the [Technical Difficulty] but then also, what will be in place by the end of this year is that 100% of what we sell will be able to be serviced digitally but only through Internet-based technologies. That's the thing which is hugely impactful to our customers. For any of you, if you're traveling on American Airlines, I encourage you if you're making changes, please use the app to do so. I think you'll find it to be a much better experience in times past and an industry-leading one as well.
Vasu Raja: Yes. And hey Mary, I think that probably the best way to answer your question is kind of taking a long view look at it. And as we look at just overall demand in our system versus 2019, we're seeing like revenue production, which could be 15%, 20% higher than what was there before. That's across the industry, but for American Airlines specifically. So when you extract yourself from like the year-over-year, quarter-to-quarter changes, what you do see is that demand for travel is materially larger. In the airline capacity is starting to catch up to what that is, but that's our reasons for saying that we see a lot of -- we see domestic on a similar demand trend line as what's been out there, and we certainly see that as we're anticipating characteristically strong peak periods. And then as far as long-haul international goes, yes, we do continue to see strength in Q4. A lot of it is -- domestic was a marketplace that for customers opened up a lot sooner and a lot more completely and comprehensive than what many of these. Many countries outside of the U.S. did. So we're still in a period where some of that demand is coming back. And we, as many are beneficiaries of that.
Vasu Raja: Well, look, Mary, in our holidays, we routinely have far more demand than we have seats for whether you want to compare it to 2022, 2021, 2019 or probably 2009. So we're in a place right now where actually our holidays are very lightly booked because we know any time we create more availability in the holidays, the seats go very quickly. So we are anticipating continued like year-over-year improvement in holiday performance. What we have been seeing in things like the days around the big peak periods also are stronger on a year-over-year booking basis, too. But still, we are in a place where the entire month of November is less than 40% booked for American Airlines. And that's deliberate because we're anticipating really a lot of the continued strength around peaks.
Vasu Raja: Inflation. Got it. Okay. Yes, look, right now, I'll say this. Air as I've said on a couple of these calls, air travel remains an amazing bargain, though indeed, the price of gas or groceries or clothing or anything is up quite a lot. Air travel is not up nearly as much. In fact, I think today, in the fall, you can fly to Las Vegas for less than $50. And my guess is just about any place you go to eat, it would cost you more to eat there. So we have yet to see something where inflation is a thing that we could go point to as a causal headwind to demand.
Vasu Raja: I'll answer the first part of it by just simply saying that we don't really comment on fare activity or sale activity for any number of reasons. But I think others can talk a little bit more about kind of margin performance.
Vasu Raja: Well, that's probably an inadvertent way to comment on fares. And look, what we continue to see is a lot of the same overall demand trend sequentially day-to-day, week-to-week, et cetera. And as I mentioned, air travel remains an amazing bargain for customers. And customers, as we've seen for several years, are keen to travel and traveling at a greater rate than what they were in 2019.
Devon May: Sure, and maybe I'll just start with fourth quarter performance and then we'll talk a little bit about 2024. And while we're not giving CASM guidance for the year, I can talk to you about some headwinds and tailwinds. So starting with fourth quarter of this year, as Vasu said, these numbers do shift around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter, but our full-year CASM-ex guide has been unchanged since the start of the year. And we knew at the start of the year, the fourth quarter was going to be our toughest comp. Our capacity starts to decelerate or capacity growth starts to decelerate a little bit as we entered the fourth quarter. We also had a couple of one-time credits that we got in the fourth quarter of 2022 that aren't happening for us this year. And then there was a shift of some expenses from the third quarter into the fourth quarter, adding a little bit more pressure. But we're still really pleased with our full-year result, hitting the guide or the midpoint of the guide that we had at the very start of the year. As we look out to 2024, the headwinds are where you'd expect. It's largely around salaries and benefits. We have open contracts with our flight attendants and our passenger service and reservations groups. If we are able to achieve deals that match industry leaders for those work groups, it'll add about a point of CASM pressure year-over-year. We also just have regular increases for other labor groups that are happening next year. But the tailwinds of what Robert talked about and what we're excited about actually working towards full utilization of our fleet. And this operation we've been running has been incredible for the last year, year and a half. Now we have a real opportunity to go ahead and do some optimization work around this operation. So we do have some headwinds on salaries and benefits. We have some real nice tailwinds as well into 2024, and we'll be able to provide more guidance on what CASM will look like on a January call.
Devon May: Hey, we'll give more guidance on 2024 as we [Technical Difficulty] salaries and benefits is an area we're going to see some pressure there. As I just mentioned, we do have this open agreement with our flight attendants and our passenger service and reservations agents that we hope to get closed and we hope to be able to match industry leading contracts there, which will drive about a point of growth. And as we get into the year, there will be some lumpiness on year-over-year comps. In the first quarter of 2023, we didn't have an accrual for our pilot agreement. So we'll see a little more cost pressure in the first quarter. But as we get into the last three quarters of the year, that cost pressure is going to ease. And then these efficiencies that we've been talking about, I think, are going to add some nice tailwinds as we go through the year. So let us get back to you in January with a little bit more detail, but that's kind of where we're seeing it right now.
Devon May: Yes, so there’s two separate things. So for 2024, our total CapEx is between $3 billion and $3.3 billion. Long-term beyond 2024, you're right that the $3.5 billion number I gave was just aircraft CapEx. So for ‘24, I think our capital requirements are such that we certainly have the ability to generate free cash flow. And we're absolutely in a different position than some of our peers, just given where they are at in terms of fleet renewal program versus where we're at. We spent over $30 billion from 2014 to 2019 on our fleet renewal. Now we're in a nice spot where capital requirements are slightly less and it does give us the ability to produce free cash flow going forward like we did in this year.
Devon May: Hey, Vasu, I'll take this. Hey, Duane, thanks. Look, we are going to be incredibly focused on making sure that we deploy assets where we can make money. The kind of things that we're talking about and focusing on our strengths are where we see that happening. And look, I think that we, you know, to the contrary, I think we carry momentum in a lot of the work that we've done this year that that Vasu has been at the center of in terms of making sure that we have the best network and we can sell, shop sell and service it digitally, is all groundwork for next year. And so as we take a look at not only the regional network, further enhancing premium product, what we will intend to do with AAdvantage and less variable revenue. I think that all plays into a lot of strength. And on top of that, look, we're in the midst of recovery still. And so as we go from quarter-to-quarter, we know that there are things that we could have done differently, you know, over the past summer that we're going to make sure that we're addressing in terms of where we're flying and how we're doing it, but we will have very little tolerance for what you would consider, kind of, investment or development flying. We're going to fly where we make money.
Devon May: Hey, Conor, it's Devon. I'll take that. And certainly, this isn't something we look at a quarterly basis, but we do spend a lot of time on benchmarking. And if you want to talk about benchmarking margins, we do think it's important to look at it and look at it on a 12-month basis and the right margin to be using when you're comparing us to these other network peers, is EBITDAR, because it just takes out financing decisions, so aircraft rent versus depreciation and interest expense, and it takes out capital structure, which we just know right now, we have a difference, but that's an area we also know we're going to improve on going forward. So let's talk about that. On EBITDAR margins, I think we stack up really well with our competitors. If you look at 12 months ended third quarter, I think we're right on top of one of them and maybe there's a small gap to the other. But I think our progress versus 2019 has been really good. And the opportunity ahead is on both sides. I do think we're going to be able to produce capacity at lower unit costs going forward or at least decelerate this unit cost growth. And I do think we have top line opportunities as well. And then the only other thing I'd close on is, well, I think we're in pretty nice shape on margins. And there's opportunity ahead. When it comes to free cash flow, I think we are unique amongst our network peers with our capital requirements going forward, and we should be able to outproduce on free cash flow for most of this decade.
Devon May: Yes. It's probably a little early to get into too much detail. We do expect to build back the regional network. We're also looking at better utilization on the mainline side. So we'll give a little more detail as we get into January.
Devon May: Well, I'll just start with right now, our focus on the balance sheet has been really on 2025. And our stated goal is that we are going to reduce $15 billion in total debt by the end of 2025. We still expect to do that at this point. And we think if we get there, that gets us to a BB credit. Beyond 2025, we'll see where it goes. But right now, we're focused on the next couple of years.
Devon May: Hey, it’s Devon. I'll just start on the XLR and then hand over to Sue. We expect our first XLR delivery to come late next year, and then the order stream starts to really pick up in 2025 and 2026.
Devon May: Yes, our fourth quarter guide, we've done it the same way we've done for all the other quarters and throughout the year. We have confidence in our revenue guide. We provide a range on it. We have a lot of confidence in our cost guide and fuel remains volatile, but we did put a range on that as well. So as it sits today, we feel really good about what we have out there for our Q4 guy.
