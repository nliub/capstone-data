Tony Capuano: Thank you, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We announced excellent first quarter results, reflecting continued momentum in our business around the world. While the timing of demand recovery has varied across regions, depending on COVID policies, it is clear that post-pandemic people have a deep appreciation for travel. As the largest global lodging company, with properties in 138 countries and territories, a diverse portfolio of amazing brands and our award-winning Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, we are proud to connect people through the power of travel. First quarter global RevPAR rose 34% versus 2022, driven by significant recovery in Asia Pacific and strong growth across the rest of our regions. Worldwide occupancy reached 65%, up 11 percentage points higher than the year ago quarter. Global ADR grew 11%, demonstrating our continued focus on driving rate. While macroeconomic uncertainty persists, it has not weighed on travel demand to date. In fact, demand continued to rise across all customer segments in the quarter. Forward bookings are solid. Though our transient booking window is still short term at around three weeks, so trends could change relatively quickly. Global leisure demand and ADR are still incredibly robust. Following a year with leisure demand already well above pre-pandemic levels, first quarter transient room nights for the segment increased 12% with ADR rising 8% year-over-year. Group demand was also very strong in the quarter. In the U.S. and Canada, group revenue for full year 2023 was pacing up 26% to 2022 at the end of the quarter, a significant improvement from group pace at the end of last year. For the second through fourth quarter of this year, group room nights were pacing up 9% with rate up 7%, leading to revenues pacing up 16% year-over-year. U.S. and Canada business transient demand saw a modest additional recovery in the quarter. ADR rose meaningfully primarily due to solid special corporate rate increases. First quarter U.S. and Canada business transient revenues surpassed 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began. And [for] cross-border travel has continued to rise globally. However, it is still a few 100 basis points below 2019 when guests traveling abroad accounted for nearly 20% of total room nights. Additional upside is expected to come primarily from Asia Pacific given international airlift to and from China is still well below pre-pandemic levels. We are focused on strengthening our Marriott Bonvoy loyalty platform by continuing to grow our membership base, which reached 182 million members at the end of March and enhancing engagement with these valuable customers. Our co-branded credit cards with offerings in nine countries performed well again this quarter. Global Card acquisitions sorted 35% year-over-year while global card spend increased 16%. To engage with our customers, we are increasingly leveraging our digital platforms which are highly profitable channels for our owners. Those digital channels had a record first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, mobile app users grew 31%, digital room nights rose 17% and digital revenues climbed 26%. Turning to development. We still expect gross rooms growth of around 5.5% this year and net rooms growth of 4% to 4.5%. While we are keeping a close eye on the financing environment, as Leeny will discuss in her remarks, we do anticipate returning to a mid-single-digit net rooms growth in the next few years. We were pleased to close the City Express transaction just yesterday, welcoming roughly 17,000 rooms in the Caribbean and Latin American region, or CALA, into our portfolio. City Express is an incredible launchpad to jumpstart our entry into the high-growth moderately priced mid-scales. We see meaningful opportunity to expand the brand in CALA as well as in other locations around the world. Our industry-leading pipeline stood at approximately 502,000 rooms at quarter end, with 57% of those rooms in international markets and about 200,000 rooms under construction. Strong interest in conversions continues, including multiunit opportunities. Conversions represented nearly 30% of signings in the quarter and 25% of openings. I'll now turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail.
Tony Capuano: Thanks, Leeny. Before we open up for questions, I just want to pause for a moment and thank our team of associates around the world who continue to do such outstanding work and are a key reason that our year is off to such a strong start. They are remarkable. I'm also excited to let you all know that we plan to hold our first Analyst Day since early 2019 at the W South Beach in Miami on Wednesday, September 27. We will open registration for that event in June. And we look forward to seeing you in South Florida and sharing a deeper dive on our business with you this fall. So now Lenny and I are happy to answer your questions.
Tony Capuano: And then, Leeny, the only thing I might add for Joe's benefits since his question was specific to China, we did see in the quarter, Joe, that Mainland China RevPAR was fully recovered to 2019 levels. But remember, the vast majority of that recovery was domestic demand. At the end of the quarter, only about 20% of the international airlift in China has recovered. I think by April, it was recovered about 40%. And so we do expect a stronger and stronger return of international demand in China through the balance of the year.
Tony Capuano: Sure. So as we think about not only the re-platforming of our major systems but also ongoing investment in our technology infrastructure, we always think about it through the lens of the impact on our associates, our guests and our owners and franchisees. I think from an associate perspective, particularly our future workforce is a workforce that has grown up opening an iPhone box with the understanding that there are no instructions and that, that technology will be intuitive and the design of our future technology will be similarly intuitive. So we think it will both be advantageous as we compete for talent, but it will also create capacity for them to more deeply engage with our guests. For our guests, we envision both at the property level and our customer engagement centers, making the breadth of information that we have about our guests available to our agents so that they can quickly and seamlessly address whatever questions or concerns or needs that those guests have. And then I think from the owner's perspective, there are both inherent operating efficiencies from new technologies that should be margin enhancing. And I also think from a revenue generation perspective, today, when you go to m.com you have the ability to book rooms. When our new systems roll out, the full breadth of products and services that we have to sell our customers, food beverage, spa, golf will be available at a single click. And we think that represents a very meaningful revenue upside.
Tony Capuano: And I might just build on that, Stephen, the -- we talked a little bit about this last quarter. Of course, the teams around the world continue to pursue individual asset conversions, but we are just as aggressively looking for portfolio conversions. You might remember that in the middle of last year we were delighted to announce an 8-hotel portfolio conversion in Vietnam that we referred to as Vinpearl. Just last month, we did Vinpearl Round 2, which was seven additional hotels, about 2,500 rooms, three of which are conversions that will open in calendar 2023. So I think that multi-unit portfolio conversion strategy is something you should reasonably expect to continue to be a focus area for our teams.
Tony Capuano: Yes, of course. So as I mentioned in the opening remarks, on the long list of attributes that excite us about this transaction, it is a great way for the company to enter the midscale segment, which is not a segment where we have competed previously. When we have talked in the past about the breadth of our portfolio, we've often responded to questions by saying we love the breadth of that portfolio for the way in which, it satisfies the wants and needs of both our guests and our owners and franchisees. And mid-scale is a tier where we hear demands from both of those constituents. Mid-scale obviously is - as from a RevPAR perspective and a rate positioning perspective, positioned below brands like Fairfield that are in our current architecture. We think there is an immediate opportunity to accelerate the growth of City Express across the Caribbean and Latin American region. As we have done with many brands that we've either developed organically or acquired. We are indeed been exploring the applicability of the City Express platform, and its growth potential in other markets around the world. And in fact here in the U. S., we're just a few weeks away from announcing a simple, modern, streamlined, new build, extended state product that has very basic services and amenities for those looking for longer stays at our mid-scale price point, and you should expect to hear more about that in the coming weeks.
Tony Capuano: And then just to put a little more context to your question, Robin. And I think this kind of tracks with the industry data that you referenced. This is system wide for the quarter, we then as compared to '22 luxury RevPAR was up 18% extended stay RevPAR was up 16% select brand RevPAR was up 23% and premium RevPAR was up 35%.
Tony Capuano: Of course, so then the fundamental strategy has not shifted. You are right to point out that prior to Starwood, there was a fairly consistent cadence of what we always refer to as bolt-on acquisitions. But the bulk of those acquisitions had some common D&A. They often helped us gain a foothold in a geography where we were dissatisfied with the pace of organic growth. And they often - we often have the view that they represented a growth platform either regionally or potentially globally. AC acquisition would be perhaps the best illustration of that. Our industry leading scale gives us maybe the luxury of not needing to do M&A to gain scale. We enjoy scale. But we will continue to look at opportunities, if we believe there is a gap in the geography where our guests seek to travel and we're dissatisfied with our footprint or if we see a gap in our brand architecture. That was what guided the City Express transaction, a transaction that solidified the strength and leadership of our footprint in the CALA region and also filled in a gap our brand architecture by giving us entry into mid-scale. But the final bit of common D&A in every one of those transactions is the discipline around the valuation, and you should expect to see that same discipline as we evaluate. What I think will be a fair number of opportunities that will be floating around out, there in the market. And then maybe the last comment I would make is, as I reflect on the last decade or more of expansion of our platform. I'm delighted that we've expanded our brand architecture through a thoughtful blend of both M&A and organically generated platforms. When I look at the success, we've had with organic launches like Autograph and Moxy and I blend that with powerhouses like Residence Inn and Ritz-Carlton and AC which were added to the system through M&A., I really like that approach.
Tony Capuano: Sure. So I'll give it a try, and Leeny feel free to jump in. As we pointed out in the prepared remarks, we continue to see robust demand recovery translating into strong occupancy growth. In fact, on a global basis, we saw 11 points of occupancy improvement in the quarter. When we think about our updated guidance, at the high end of that guidance, we expect our RevPAR growth to be fairly evenly split between ADR and occupancy gains. So, we do expect there to be continued occupancy gains at the high end of that guidance. The low end of the range would, reflect a meaningful softening in the global economy in the back half of the year. And that would have worldwide RevPAR relatively flat, compared to where we were in the back half of last year.
Tony Capuano: Yes. So the way I'd answer that, Patrick, we've already been showing it. The discussions we've been having with the various jurisdictions are, just about making sure that the transparency of those disclosures is enhanced and crystal clear for our guests. It is not as if those were hidden somehow, we're simply further clarifying and enhancing that transparency. I will leave it to the state AGs around the rest of the country for the rest of the industry. But I am pleased, that we will lead the industry in terms of the transparency of our disclosure for our guests.
Tony Capuano: Yes, I don't think there's necessarily a typical percentage. If I had to guess over the last decade or so, it's probably relatively evenly split, between an owner that simply has an opportunity to change brands or to flag an independent hotel versus an opportunity that is, created as a result of a transaction. But I think that ebbs and flows a bit depending on where we find ourselves in an economic cycle.
Tony Capuano: Yes. So I think the borders are just opening, the economy is just starting to really gear up. So it's a bit soon for new construction starts. What I can tell you is some of the in-flight construction projects that have been paused have restarted. Our approval volumes are accelerating, the volume of memorandums of understanding that we're negotiating and executing are accelerating. So all of the leading indicators that should drive construction starts are really encouraging, but probably a bit premature to have any really strong data for you.
Tony Capuano: And maybe the last point I would add, because we're so heavily weighted to the most valuable quality tiers of our upscale and luxury, oftentimes when we engage with the owner, the project is well under construction. So unlike the U.S., where our conversations start with a greenfield site, they may come to us with a tower of 25 stories out of the ground. So it's a bit of an apples to orange comparison.
Tony Capuano: And the only other small note I would make, and I'm sure you're aware of this, with Chinese government just pivoted a bit and said that those foreign visas issued prior to March 28 of '20, that initially, they have said would need to be renewed, those are now available for use for entry into Mainland China, which should pave the way for greater inbound international because of the queue for new visa processing for international visitors had been quite lengthy.
Tony Capuano: Yes. Not yet. I mean I think the best statistical data we have is the recovery by day of the week, and we continue to see strong recovery on Sundays and Thursdays, which is probably the most compelling empirical data we have that suggests that blended trip purpose continues to be strong. And then I would supplement that data with what we hear anecdotally when we're talking both with special corporate customers and with group customers who are talking to us as we re-platform our technology and encouraging us to make it easier for their business travelers or their group meeting attendees to book a single reservation that has both business and leisure purposes. So our sense is that, that trend shows no sign of slowing down. And as I've said in other forums, that's great news for our business.
Tony Capuano: Great. Well, thank you all again for your thoughtful questions. Thanks for your interest in Marriott International. We hope to accommodate you in what should be a terrific summer around the world. And we look forward to welcoming all of you to the beach in Miami in the fall for our Investor Day. Have a great afternoon. Thank you.
Leeny Oberg: Thanks. Sure. So let me just kind of set the stage a little bit, and that is that you -- we talked about the fact that IMF's essentially doubled Q1 over Q1. And certainly, a huge part of that was driven by Asia Pacific in their great RevPAR recovery. So again, broadly speaking, if you call it, $100 million increase in IMF, about $30 million to $40 million of that came from Asia Pacific. So definitely with a disproportionate increase in RevPAR relative to the rest of the world, they were a big provider. As you know, Joe, generally, our incentive fees in Asia Pacific do not include an owner's priority. So they tend to be not quite as lumpy in terms of the way that they return. So we would expect, as you see incentive fees for the remainder of this year, to continue to show that characteristic. And I guess the best way to put it is that if we hit the high end of our guidance, you could expect to see incentive fees globally actually surpass the peak levels that we had in 2019. And then the only other thing that I'll point out is that, obviously, our managed rooms, which make up about 550,000 rooms out of 1.5 million, over 75% of them are full-service rooms. So as you see the strength in both group and returning business transient and continued leisure demand, I think that bodes well for IMF.
Leeny Oberg: No, I think we always get requests for financial support, and we're happy to consider them. I do think, Joe, at the end of the day, the largest area of the capital stack, particularly in the U.S. that needs to be filled, is the senior loan. And so from that perspective, that is not a place where we typically get requests. And so around the edges, I would say there's a bit more request for whether they're debt service guarantees or operating profit guarantees, and that obviously is for managed properties. But I would say that, broadly speaking, the level of capital that we're putting into deals has not changed meaningfully. That this really is more about a temporary slowdown in the bank's willingness to get some of these financings over the finish line.
Leeny Oberg: And Stephen, the only thing that I'll add is just a reminder that this is really a multiyear process that -- we talked about it a quarter ago, we talked about it again today, and that is that, I mean, we're thrilled with what we see for the potential with this and that, that will impact this year's investment spending, but we expect this will take several years.
Leeny Oberg: Well, I'll make a couple of comments. First of all, the continued strength in conversions is obviously great for our visibility into the pipeline. They tend to be shorter to actually open, they tend to be clearer and exactly what needs to be done to be able to put our flag on them. And you've seen that we continue to put out really strong numbers on both signings and openings. The other trend that we've noticed over the past couple of years is increasing comfort internationally with conversions. And as you think about our soft brands, that really started, frankly, in the U.S. with Autograph and then have now really expanded as you think about Autograph Luxury collection tribute and to some extent, Delta, you really see those spreading more around the world. And that obviously gives us better visibility both for the rooms that are going to open and frankly, really helps support the net rooms growth thesis that we have.
Leeny Oberg: Sure. I think you heard me talk about the 4% to 7% expectation for 2023, which is obviously a bit different as it relates to fees from RevPAR given what we're seeing in the lodging operations for the year. So I think overwhelmingly, as you know, the non-RevPAR fees are co-brand credit card fees. Those are the largest chunk. And they are going to tie to both the number of cardholders and the level of average spend. I think it won't surprise you that as you've seen people start to amount of COVID that we are seeing the average spend on credit card increases year-over-year moderate. But I will also say that the number of cardholders is growing very nicely. So I would say that it is relatively speaking, more growth coming from the increased base of cardholders than it is on the actual spend, but it is a great combination of the two of them. The other thing is on our resi fees, on our resi branding fees, they over a kind of three to five year time horizon, they've just been growing beautifully as there's great demand for that product of ours, but they are a bit lumpier in terms of when the actual residences open. And that, I think you should expect to see that it will continue to grow over time, but that it can vary quarter-to-quarter quite meaningfully given the onetime nature of those fees.
Leeny Oberg: So business transient room nights are down about 1% versus 2019. Obviously, the rate has been terrific, particularly with the most recent renegotiation at the special corporate rate.
Leeny Oberg: On economy which largely as you might imagine, I think we don't play very much there really in any meaningful way. I think it's not a surprise when you see that just generally speaking in economy, there tends to be less variability both up and down over time than you see in the highest end rates. But I think again, I will point out on luxury, Robin that we're still very, very pleased with what we see in terms of luxury demand. And frankly, when you think, for example, people having more opportunities of where they want to travel. It's one of the benefits of being the size and scale of our system, because they're actually may not be going to some places domestically, that they were going before, but can now actually go abroad.
Leeny Oberg: Sure. I think it's a great question to be able to reinforce where we are, which is that we have been for some time continue to be and expect for the rest of this year to continue to be at the low end of the investment grade leverage targets. So the biggest chunk of all, of the chunk relative to the increase in capital return is from the increase in expected EBITDA and cash flow for the company. So if you think about broadly speaking, the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA going up between $250 million and $300 million, it's pretty straight math to see that that can get you to this increase of call it roughly $700 million of midpoint of capital return. So, we feel really strong about the way the business is operating, from a cash flow performance as well as the visibility that we've got, certainly in the near-term. But even at the lower end of the guidance that we provided, I think, we still feel really good about being at the low end of our leverage targets with the kind of capital return range that, we've given.
Leeny Oberg: So the only thing, I'll add is it is interesting when you look at occupancy compared to 2019, and we do continue to make progress in that comparison. When I look at U.S. and Canada kind of moving through from January through March of this Q compared to '19, we're down to only two percentage points, difference by the time we're at March. And globally, actually, we're only two percentage points in March as well. I think there are a couple of things to note. Number one is the portfolios are pretty different. We've added 11% more rooms since 2019. So the comparison starts to be not completely apples-to-apples. And I think there's, also been some great learnings on the part of the industry about revenue management. And there, I think at the end of the day, we're trying to make sure that we're maximizing the returns on these real estate assets. And then as you've seen with group, for example, there's actually been some benefit over the reality that group is booking closer to the time of the actual event. So I think, we will eventually get back there. We are getting fairly close. But I think the best part is that you're seeing the fundamental business segments of business, transient leisure and group really all operating on full cylinders, not exactly the way they behaved in 2019, but still really in good shape.
Leeny Oberg: Yes. So for the first quarter, globally, the member penetration was 53% and in the U.S., it was 60%.
Leeny Oberg: No, that has stayed that's at about 11%, and that is quite similar to what was pre-COVID. I think the interesting part is that you look at either the digital channels which have grown 600 basis points since pre-COVID or if you look at all of Marriott's direct channels together. We've actually grown share about 100 basis points since pre-COVID, but the OTAs have remained roughly flat.
Leeny Oberg: Sure. So yes, you've got the basic parameters roughly right, which is those that have started construction, you would expect those to be already be financed. There's not a specific number on firm financing for that other 60%. That's an ongoing process and always has been between the developers as they consider their various capital sources. One thing to remember in that is, that our pipeline is over 50% international, which does tend to be less dependent on senior loan financing. And then for the remainder, in the U.S., it is overwhelmingly limited service of franchised properties. And those from a relative speaking basis, we do believe that there is some slowdown in the pace of financing for those, but we are, at the same time, continuing to see that banks are willing to consider loans for strong brands and strong proven markets. And we are still seeing that lenders are looking at those projects. So, I don't think that there is a fundamental change in how we see those projects materializing and to actually build hotels. I'd also remind you that there's, quite a few conversion hotels in that as well. So I think, as you've probably seen in past times where lending has had a slowdown that there can be a bit of a slowdown and the construction starts. But that we do expect with the performance of the hotel business and frankly, the relative performance of hotel loans, particularly in limited service loans, we would expect that to get going again more quickly. We aren't seeing fall out of those deals from our pipeline in anything more than a typical fashion.
Leeny Oberg: Well, we're certainly going to have as many as we can, you can be sure of that. I think I'd make two comments. First of all, certainly with the use of revolving credit in the U.S., that is by far, the lion's share of, the fees that we received are related to the U.S. But I would say the rate of growth that we're seeing in terms of both the, spend and the cardholder numbers in international is really quite tremendous. Both in terms of the numbers of cards - numbers of countries, that we're adding cards as well as the number of cardholders in those countries. So, we've been really pleased with the increases for example, in Japan, in South Korea, in terms of the growth in cardholders. And I think that bodes really well for future growth, but also for our hotel growth and for our hotel business, because these are all Bonvoy members who want to be earning points and staying at our properties. So it's a great part of the ecosystem of our business.
Leeny Oberg: Well, I think the best way - we don't have a particular percentage. As you know, we don't control exactly when they open. We do keep a very careful eye on how they are doing, and again, feel comfortable with the numbers that we've talked - that Tony talked about in terms of the gross room openings, which has both a share of those coming out from under construction as well as conversions.
Leeny Oberg: And I'll just add one other point that may be as you try to come up with your own math, is just a reminder that for hotel construction and a limited service hotel is roughly speaking, two years under construction and a full-service hotel can be anywhere from three to four.
Leeny Oberg: The other thing I'll point out is that roughly speaking, about 15% of our Chinese pipeline deals have some state-owned enterprise participation. And I think that does help as you think about the capital sourcing for those projects that is helpful as we get those ongoing again.
Leeny Oberg: Yes, sure. Absolutely. So I do -- if you look at year-over-year Q1, you are right in pointing out that the U.S. IMF, which came close to doubling in Q1 from 42 to 85, actually did double, that growth was overwhelmingly driven by the premium hotels was the return of group and business transient to our premium hotels. We did continue to see growth in IMF from our luxury hotels, but the biggest chunk of growth came from those premium hotels. So I think with the strength of group that Tony pointed out, in his comments for the rest of the year that you should continue to see the strong growth in both U.S. and Canada IMFs as well as international.
Leeny Oberg: Sure. So I'll start with the second question first, and then Tony will fill in also. And that is, yes, on the second question. While we actually have seen the dollar soften a little bit more than where we were relative to when we gave guidance earlier in February, the reality is that we are still seeing great demand for Europe hotels for the summer and very pleased with the booking patterns we see there. On Greater China, let me talk about a couple of things. First of all, cross-border, just a reminder of our comments earlier that roughly three quarters of the business typically is domestic. Well, right now, it's over 90% is domestic. So I think there is the reality that there's going to be more travel both in and out of Greater China as demand -- as the airlift improve. So we would expect to see that help both other parts of the world, but also that there's more travel into China. In terms of the segment, it's seeing the recovery in segments very similar to the way that we saw it in other parts of the world. The one difference being that on special corporate and business transient in China that is recovering much more quickly than it did in the U.S. For example, overwhelmingly, people are back in their offices in Greater China, while in the U.S., there's obviously much more of a hybrid mix. So we are actually seeing all of the segments recover more in line with each other rather than necessarily one after another the way it was in the U.S.
Leeny Oberg: Yes. I would probably consider it about the timing of the recovery. So a couple of broad comments. Generally speaking, lodging demand does have a high correlation with GDP growth. So when you think of emerging economies like India, as an example, where you're seeing 6% GDP growth, that's going to be very different than what you see in the U.S. where more typical GDP growth might be more like 2%, and so the impact of a recession can be different in that regard. But I think when I think about the guidance that we've given this year, it is much more tied to the pace of recovery. The U.S., for example, meaningfully farther along in its recovery from COVID than Asia Pacific, for example. And I think we're clearly seeing that now all restrictions are lifted in Asia Pacific and that both pent-up demand and return of demand is coming quite nicely, which will mean that should we see an economic slowdown, I think they will be impacted a bit less than, for example, in the U.S., where obviously in the U.S., if we see it, it's starting from a different point. So again, as we talked about, we would imagine that Q3 and Q4 and that slowdown does mean that there is a meaningful economic slowdown. I'm not sure I would call it a super sharp deep V. But clearly, a real meaningful economic slowdown that would get us to that roughly flat RevPAR in Q3 and Q4 compared to '22.
