Prahlad Singh: Thank you, Steve. Building off our June 24 Analyst Day, today represents another milestone in the transformation of the new PerkinElmer. The addition of BioLegend expands our presence in the attractive high growth antibody and cytokine market, enhances our content development capabilities across all PerkinElmer detection technologies and transforms our E-scale - our E commerce scale overnight. Personally, I couldn't be more thrilled to work with Gene and the team going forward. And I'm excited to see the impact the combined company can have on scientific innovation.
Prahlad Singh: Thank you, Gene. I want to formally welcome you and your team to the PerkinElmer family. And as we've discussed over the last few months, as we've gotten to know each other. I'm so excited for what this means for both companies, and what the combined business is going to be able to do together in the years to come. I'm now on Slide 4. Let me tell you some more about BioLegend. It's a world class organization, propelled by a strong team top to bottom. The company has achieved leading market positions in a number of attractive high growth end markets, such as antibody development, flow cytometry reagents, proteogenomics, magnetic cell separation, recombinant proteins, cytokines and growth factors. These represent a total addressable market of approximately $6 billion, with areas of expertise that span from upstream research and immunology, oncology, stem cell research, neuroscience and infectious disease to downstream bioprocessing. It's more than 700 employees across the US and Asia Pacific Europe serve over 10,000 customers in 130 countries. The company also has a stellar track record of new product introduction launching over 1,000 NPIs annually in both new and existing markets. Moreover, all of its revenue is recurring in nature and its world class manufacturing and distribution capabilities translate to its very attractive incremental margin profile. Finally, what you'll come to recognize is that both PerkinElmer and BioLegend share a fierce passion and commitment to focusing on the customer. BioLegend mission is helping scientists accelerate research and discovery by providing the highest quality products at an outstanding value, along with superior customer service and technical support. But more succinctly said the BioLegend team is passionate about making a mark on the world and being legendary in their own right at pushing the boundaries of biological understanding.
Prahlad Singh: Its great question, Doug. As you pointed out, historically, while we've had a strong portfolio of M&R assays to support drug discovery for both small molecule and biological approaches. Our recent acquisitions they were aimed to broaden our offering along the whole workflow from basic research and target identification, all the way to manufacturing and QC, with a special focus around growth areas such as cell and gene therapy that I've pointed out earlier. The combined position, positions as much better to deliver solutions. For example, to offer engineered cell lines with matched downstream - or specific QC production cell lines. To give you a few examples, for example with Horizon, BioLegend could use the engineered cell lines for reagent validation. And there are many tools that are complementary with BioLegend's content development efforts around antibodies, model systems et cetera. Similarly, on Cisbio, the HTRF and α ELISA assays. They are very synergistic and - we could go on down with Bioo Scientific, or Nexcelom. The opportunities are there for each of these businesses and once we start connecting the dots, we are able to bring total solutions into the marketplace and that is why this is a really exciting opportunity for us.
Prahlad Singh: That's a fair point, Doug. I mean, I will say that today as we sit here in San Diego, our focus is on talking about the opportunities that the combined company brings to us. But I think it's fair to say that, over the next several months, our focus will be on ensuring that this is a seamless combination and transformation of the company, as we focus on creating a $700 million life sciences reagent franchise.
Prahlad Singh: I think, I would put it in a succinct manner, Vijay, that once you focus on the science piece, it's the cost, it’s the quality and it's the service. Those are the three words that define BioLegend. And we've talked to customers throughout our due diligence process globally. And those three things are the shining light of the company. And that is what really excited us to the opportunity and I think that is the growth trajectory that the combined company is going to focus on.
Prahlad Singh: Well, I mean, in general, our applied genomics business was down from a COVID standpoint, because we put up so many instruments last year, and obviously NGS surveillance is meaningful, but relatively small compared to broad base PCR testing and extraction, so significant for the applied genomics business, but not overall meaningful to the entire COVID revenue perspective.
Prahlad Singh: There's a nominal amount in our second half guide Dan, so that program is difficult to predict just how large it'll be, the team is doing a great job getting it set up and I think we received our first few samples, not from a back-to-school perspective but don't forget it also takes into account congregate settings as well. So I think predicting the September through December and truly the contract goes through the end of November, how much back-to-school testing that will be is difficult, so we put in a nominal amount and I think it just continues to give us confidence in the second half COVID guide that if you look at the first half, we've continued to outperform and thought that it was prudent to just kind of keep that number right now.
Prahlad Singh: Yes. So we continued to invest heavily in R&D, in particular. So we do anticipate that it continues to ramp here Derik, as well as, as you look at the second half. I think in total, I looked at the 3Q, 4Q splits, I think in total, they're pretty much accurate. The only other thing that's coming down a little bit, we've got a little bit of extra growth, we've got a little bit of pressure on our COVID margins that we're assuming gears. And otherwise, I think we're pretty much in line with the second half.
Prahlad Singh: Yes, thanks for that. I'll start and then the teams here with me - so, feel free to chime in as well. But it's a beautiful facility. I think it's one year, two years old. So, - and it's got four significant buildings here, I'd say there's ample room for capacity growth for many years to come. So, - right and I don't think there's a lot of investment required, so every year there might be a little bit of CapEx, but I don't think it's substantial in the grand scheme of the overall investment strategy for the company. So, long story short, beautiful facility, tremendous distribution capabilities, tremendous technology capabilities, and a lot of room to expand even within the existing footprint.
Prahlad Singh: Yes, I think a large portion of the free cash flow is going to go to de-levering, for sure. So, I think we're in a great spot right now. I think we're still generating a significant amount of cash, over 100% of our net income. So, as we look at - as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we think we can de-lever within 18 to 24 months. I think any acquisitions would be very material in the grand scheme of things and will knock us off our de-levering path here.
Prahlad Singh: I think it's a combination of all three of what you mentioned Josh, obviously, there's a global reach and stronger exposure in an EU and APAC at the same time. They have a strong penetration in the academic marketplace, where we've been a little bit under index and that's where it could help us on one side. And we can provide better cross-selling opportunities in pharma. So I think from a geographic perspective, there are opportunities on both sides and there are some markets where we could help both sides. And Jamey talked earlier on the channel piece and I talked about the technology piece, so I don't know if there's anything else. 
Prahlad Singh: Yes, we have Craig Monell here who's the Head of Product Strategy & Commercial Operations here, take over.
Prahlad Singh: Yes. Sure. Great question, Tycho, I mean as I've shared with you before what we've tried - we've done at the beginning of the year or early - on the latter part of last year. We have put together what we call as an integration transformation office. And if you actually look through the flow of how the acquisitions have come in into PerkinElmer and the way we've sort of sequence them. They go into different business area, or different portfolios or different end markets. So we've had a very diligent and a deliberate sequence of the acquisitions. And I think, you're right at the going - you're right in the fact that going forward you will probably hit the pause button for some time till we fully integrate this and have a seamless transition of all of these into the PerkinElmer family.
Prahlad Singh: Thank you all for joining us this morning. We are more excited about the future of PerkinElmer now than ever before. I also want to take the opportunity to welcome the BioLegend team to the PerkinElmer family. I look forward to speaking to all of you soon. Thank you very much.
Jamey Mock: Thanks a lot. I echo the same sentiments. It's been great to meet Gene and the team who are here with us today, and I'm equally excited about the impact we can have on improving outcomes for all stakeholders. The addition of BioLegend further accelerates the transformation of the new PerkinElmer and it positions us to deliver even stronger financial performance, top to bottom, in the years ahead.  As we most recently told you at our investor day last month, we outline here again on Slide 7, we expect the existing PerkinElmer business to grow 5% to 7% organically per year, through 2023, and in the mid-single to high single digit range, longer term as we deliver on our strategic imperatives. Given the size and expected growth of BioLegend, combined with the revenue synergies we expect to start contributing in year one, we see the combined company growing at least 100 basis points faster annually than our previous outlook in both the near and long term. As you know, with an expected close by the end of this year, BioLegend won't start positively impacting our organic growth until 2023 when it's added to our base. And since BioLegend’s revenue is entirely reagents and consumables, PerkinElmer will now have around 75% of its revenue by recurring in nature, up a few 100 basis points from pre-COVID levels. Given BioLegend’s accretive margin profile, we now expect overall company operating margins to increase by approximately 300 basis points from current levels by 2023. We expect our previously communicated goal of 50 to 75 basis points of annual operating margin expansion to continue, with improvements in the existing PKI business to largely come with the gross margin line from our operational excellence initiatives that we highlighted at our recent analysts meeting. While we expect BioLegend’s rapid top line growth to provide some opportunities at the OpEx line, while continuing to reinvest heavily in R&D, as the company has throughout its history. Today, more than 50% of BioLegend’s business is through their e-commerce channels. We plan to leverage this with our Horizon Ansys bio platforms to further scale this ecosystem, with approximately $700 million in annualized life science research revenues. We have the opportunity to rapidly scale our go to market synergies across the portfolio.
Jamey Mock: Yes. Thanks, Catherine. So right now I think the primary driver is to expand the global reach. So you saw on the pages that BioLegend is currently concentrated roughly 55% in the U.S., our life sciences reagents business is more like 40% to 45%. So I think we can expand globally with our more than 500 sales and service folks across the globe. So that's the primary driver. And then we have many different opportunities with Cisbio, with NexION, with Horizon, with the diagnostic side. So we think that $100 million is very achievable, we discuss with the team over the last few days and months, I should say that we believe that it could be much more than that. But I think right now the primary driver that we're banking on is geographic region.
Jamey Mock: Yes, I mean, it's a good question, Catherine, it's actually very difficult to pinpoint because it is extremely broad based, I mentioned that every geography across the globe is up almost equivalently, every end market is up, it's almost difficult to find a spot that we are concerned about. So, it's really - everything we have, I can't really highlight one for you, like science is a strong, applied is kicking back in, food is strong, reproductive health is doing extremely well, immunodiagnostics I mentioned EUROIMMUN being up strong double digits. And everybody is above the 2019 levels and many of these markets are now on an average two-year stack comparison, at least mid-single digit, if not double digit growth comparing the 2019. So life science as an example is up 10% on average over the last few years.
Jamey Mock: Yes. So the number that was on the page Doug is a 2022 number that $380 million just to clarify that.
Jamey Mock: And the BioLegend has been around for 20 years. 20th - the 20th year I think will be next year. So, they've been growing consistently 20% plus over time, and I think that tries to help you kind of think about what they've been able to achieve historically. And then we've put in at least mid-teens plus is what we said and that's before synergies back to Prahlad’s point there's, I talked about geographic reach, Prahlad talked about all the complimentary nature of all of our acquisitions. I mean, the antibodies are used in everything we do all the life sciences, reagents everything and diagnostics, and our teams to the extent that we could, started to understand the technology that PerkinElmer has and BioLegend has that number from a synergy standpoint, it's more difficult to predict. The geographic reach is easier to quantify. So I think there should be upside to this $100 million. But with the teams need to understand the products a little bit more. But the $380 million is 2022 and they've been historically growing 20% plus over the last five years even during COVID we grew, 4%, 5%.
Jamey Mock: Yes, Vijay, that math is accurate, so they're in the - we're in the 50% kind of EBITDA range. So operating profit might be a touch lower than that, but from an EBITDA perspective, it's in the 50% range. And I think that math should hold when you look at $0.30 accretion in 2022. And then we said greater than $0.50 accretion in 2023. So we'll see what kind of room for upside there is there, but that's what we're establishing right now as guidance.
Jamey Mock: I appreciate the question Derik, but I don't think we're going to get into 2022 guidance at this point.
Jamey Mock: Yes, China, as I mentioned my prepared remarks, grew in the high 20% range and probably a little bit better than our expectations. If you remember the sequencing of last year, Josh, the first quarter was the worst for China, second quarter got better, I think we reported at the time we were down mid-teens. So, being up high 20s out of mid comp kind of gives you high single-digit average two-year stack growth here, and I think it's performing across the board. So life science is never really dipped down. Life sciences was strong, during all 2020 remain strong. Food was a little bit more challenged, so food, it’s nice to see I mentioned in my prepared remarks Meizheng coming back quite nicely. The Analytical business is coming back. Reproductive health also, the utilization started to uptick last year, but we're coming off a little bit of an easier comp from a birth rate and testing perspective. So, really all facets of the business are performing nicely. EUROIMMUN is doing extremely well. So I mentioned EUROIMMUN being up strong double-digits and much of that was led by China. So overall, probably a little bit better than we expected, and as you look to the second half, I don't think we see that slowing down at this point. 
Jamey Mock: Yes. I’ll start by reiterating kind of what we said at Investor and Analyst Day, which is to say that the original $100 million that we put forward had nothing to do with actual testing, it had everything to do with the utilization of the strong installed base that we put out there. So certainly, are we're becoming increasingly confident that there's going to be some amount of testing that's here for the foreseeable future. I think we're already starting to see that in the third quarter - early part of the third quarter. I think some of our serology testing, PCR testings, antigen even is starting to go make a little bit of a inroads there, variant testing T cells. So I’d say we're more confident leading into 2022 that they're $100 million of durable COVID revenue is safe, both from utilization standpoint, but then I think testing will remain around for a while here and should provide upside to that number.
Jamey Mock: Should have been doing great, great collaboration and progress on all of the value drivers that we had. In terms of first half, strong organic growth obviously off of a fairly easy comparison, but you know in line are ahead of our deal model at this point. If you look at the value drivers from an automation perspective there's been a lot of progress in liquid handling and cell isolation and maybe even looking at cell counting moving forward here, as well as utilization of some of our labs. From a commercial perspective, I think we've helped each other win in certain markets, some of the emerging markets of Brazil, some parts of the Middle East and across the globe we've won some nice tenders, so exciting there and it's a phenomenal team, extremely well driven business. I think they're excited about the synergy and the pace with PerkinElmer and even more confident in the potential ahead. 
Jamey Mock: So yes. So from a financing perspective, you know, primarily we're super excited that the team was willing to take 40% equity, I think it shows their commitment to the company, their excitement for the company, their excitement for what the combined entity can do, so that's that takes care of 2.2 billion or roughly 40% of the overall consideration when you factor in their cash as well. We have a bridge fully committed at this point. So, we're fine from a financing perspective, we don't anticipate using that, I think in advance that we will take out permanent debt. I think it'll be relatively low cost, at this point and we're pretty excited about that which provides a good amount of VPS accretion at this point.  And then from a tax rate perspective based in the State of California, so a little bit higher state tax, but overall, that's already embedded into everything that I've given to you. the last thing I say is that, the rating agencies have, you know, we've reached them and they should be out today, but we fully expect to remain investment credit rating here at this point. 
Jamey Mock: Yes. So, if you look at last year, first as the comparison, the second quarter was the easiest comparison and DAS got, I think it was down low single digits in the third and fourth quarter here, so from a comparables perspective that will naturally, but from a growth perspective I think it's continued to be extremely strong. So life sciences now makes up over 60% of the DAS business. There is no reason to believe that DAS slows down, maybe from a comp perspective, it gets a little bit more difficult, but overall, I mentioned cannabis is starting to sell again so that's encouraging, the imaging business and food quality - food safety is growing nicely. Our applied business, I think that's been a testimony to the MPIs, the organic investment we've made. So I mentioned the semiconductor business and our NexION 5000, which is extremely sensitive, is terrific for smaller wafers and fabs. Our new IR product is going well. So I think if you remember and step back for the applied markets value creation story is much more of an organic investment belief. And we've been investing in R&D, we've been up ticking the R&D, and I think that cadence of new product introduction is encouraging and so we expect that to continue to perform well in the second half year.
