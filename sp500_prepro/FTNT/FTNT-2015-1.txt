Michelle Spolver: Thank you, John, and thank you everybody for joining the call this afternoon to discuss Fortinet's financial results for the first quarter 2015. With me today are Ken Xie, Fortinet’s Founder, Chairman and CEO and Drew Del Matto, CFO. As for the structure of the call, Ken will begin by providing perspective on our business and product advantages, Drew will then review our Q1 financial and operating results and conclude with our forward guidance outlook, before opening the call for questions.

With that let me now turn the call over to Ken.
Michelle Spolver: And then I would add Jonathan, it’s Michelle, Jonathan. The only thing I would add is that is I think you covered three points and specifically the multilayered security was one of that. That is still early on in the process. Ken mentioned, that we had deals in that but it is still early. So I would say that is more of a growth driver than with contributing to growth right now.
Michelle Spolver: And then Subul the only thing I would add to it is Michelle and we talked about most of the deals that we highlighted as some of the key deals for the quarter were data center, enterprise data center deals or is the core next generation firewall or firewall. So I mean we don’t - we haven’t broken out where we are not reporting a metric in terms of breaking out the enterprise business by the type of deployment but I would say if you look at Fortinet today versus two or three years ago there would be a higher concentration for sure of the data center security versus for the branch type deployment.
Michelle Spolver: So I will say most of them are displacements, I mean there is some of them that enterprise, I think what it is and we talked about it our script is that enterprise, many enterprises are looking at rather than just replacing a firewall, one firewall for a new firewall and changing vendors, its looking at doing it differently whether its going from the single function firewall to a multi function security solution or building out the infrastructure, look at the security differently but its not straight Greenfield type opportunity it really as far as displacing incumbents.
Michelle Spolver: All right, thank you everybody. Thanks especially we had a busy day. We are having a busy week. So thanks for all your time today. For those of you who have additional questions, we will continue to do our second call at 3.30 PM, so feel free to call back there. And everybody who's at RSA will be there this week. Our booth number is 4400. Come by, come look at the technology and hopefully we will see lot of people there. That's it. That concludes our call today. Thank you very much.
Andrew Del Matto: We hold to our annualized guidance of two or better on inventory turns, we don’t think that will change, we just - this issue we talked about in the January call, we were really concerned about the port strike for anybody in the Bay area, we saw the Bay, you could see all the ships parked in the middle of the Bay there for quite a while and lot of our products was sitting out there. So we literally have to fly things in which actually is what - then they held the strike and then we got our inventory off the boats and the stuff we flight in, so we had a little more inventory than we probably would have liked. We’re moving the inventories, we don't have it overall inventory problem if you will, or an obsolescence problem but it did cause us to go below the two threshold, I think here temporarily. The other thing I would point out on that is flying it in cost a lot more than shipping it in be it water, and then also touched us a bit on the product gross margin line.
Andrew Del Matto: Sure Jonathan. Quite frankly it is just excellent execution on our go-to-market model there. I think we made our early investments there probably earlier than we have made elsewhere. And the team there is just performing exceptionally well as you can see in the phase of top currency headwind to be frank and I think we attribute that to basically having the right leadership, having the right team and then building out the marketing side of the go-to-market model very well and so they have done very well in terms of building kind of an integrated end-to-end go-to-market model which we are replicating elsewhere. We would also like to point - I guess I would also point out that the people we’ve seen come in and ramp there are ramping faster than we’ve seen historically, I think in Fortinet and so over the last year that team has ramped faster than their predecessors would say and I think that attributes to the investments we’ve made on the marketing side. And just getting it right bringing in professionals who’ve been there, done that and doing it here with an excellent product set. That combined with what I would characterize as an excellent security opportunity combined with our best breed integrated platform is just resonating extremely well there.
Andrew Del Matto: I will do my best. I think you could tell from our verticals numbers that those haven’t shifted much but I think the growth really is coming out of the Enterprise segment and I would characterize that more towards larger end of the enterprise. Right now we seem to do very well, where people take a very hard look at the products, they look at the strategy in terms of integrated best of breed and our focus that we can provide. Then they also test the products and as the NSS test which Ken referred to obviously play a role. They are very savvy, sophisticated differentiating buyers and we resonate extremely well at that level. So I think that's the key thing and the other thing I would say is we are getting the right marketing dollars in place. So customers know who we are before we get there, they have a sense for us and provide us a great opportunity along with bringing in professionals with relationship. That is new enterprise, the large, high enterprise sales force didn’t really exist several years ago and so that is something that we’ve done more recently and expanded into the verticals probably in the last six months or so. So that’s what we’re seeing, we’re also seeing these people as we build the go to market engine, get the marketing right, the legend side of it right, we’re seeing people, seeing sales people ramp faster than they historically ramped before.
Andrew Del Matto: And just also point out I think the enterprise is where the security sea level boardroom issue is most profound. So we are kind of hitting the mark there I think.
Andrew Del Matto: Great question, Brent. So we announced the increase in middle of January. It actually takes somewhere between 30 to 90 days to really work its way through the channel. So I don't just say best case here, you are getting it in quotes in probably early March possibly late February. But most of it isn’t - I would say it's too early to call from that perspective. I don’t think it provided much of the tailwind if you say from the billings perspective, I think that too early. What it does do interestingly enough is because the way we actually estimate the revenue piece, the product a little more gets differed now because you're actually attributing, you have a higher differed component or subscription component, routable component if you will. And so it actually takes down the near term revenue just the end quarter revenue a little bit because you’re now marking - you kind of benchmark that deferred component to the new price which is a little bit higher. And so, I would say if anything, I mean on billings it was probably neutral, on revenue its probably a couple million of just kind of pushed to deferred if you will. I wouldn’t call that hugely significant but just point out that it in terms of how it impacted us its probably slight near term mark on revenue, little up on deferred revenue and because the product revenue goes down a little bit it also impacts the products a bit.
Andrew Del Matto: Yes I think so, and I could say this, if you want a qualitative perception we've been talking to the field, its something that our channel really likes especially as you get into the mid and higher level deals it just gets increasingly important. They are like a higher price, they think there is a lot of value there. We do a really good job of enriching our product offerings over time as we add components to it, the functionality and keeping it up to date. And so, the channel likes it the higher price means more money for them.
Andrew Del Matto: Sure Matthew. Again we've guided for Q2 and we've guided for the full year of 2014 and so obviously it implies a ramp. I'm going to have to let you how you want to do it from your model perspective but we’re very comfortable with the 2014. Our comfort has to do with the fact one, that what we look at internally suggest we’re very conscious about how and where we spend, we’re very disciplined. Again I would point out that’s its all on the sales and marketing line, a lot of it is very programmatic and headcount driven at this point and so we know the dials on how to engineer that result if we need to. And quite honestly we feel very good about our forecast and how we are going to proceed through the year. Our plans are very crisp and we’re going to execute those and if we do that, which we believe we will then, we are very comfortable we can hit that target.
Andrew Del Matto: Well from a percentage perspective obviously get to 2014 and probably have improved but from a dollar perspective it’s just, we know what the programs are, there are still some investment to make, we are kind of I would characterize it kind of mid-stream especially on the marketing side the verticals still have a little, you have to give them a little time to pay off. I think we are somewhere between four to six months into that program and I think it’s reasonable to get people a year there to bear some fruit. And so I would call it kind of more mid-stream if you will.
Andrew Del Matto: No I think it’s very similar again Imtiaz we don’t focus, we were agnostic as to the duration of the contract from a customer perspective, we let choose that and I think if anything I think if you look at the ratio long-term deferred to short-term deferred, overall deferred I think it might even compressed a little bit.
Andrew Del Matto: Well I think the margins overall have been consistent, we’ve forecasted 71% and we hit that. The services margins I would highlight that those are very good and our focus has been on selling more subscriptions and virtual offerings and that looks to be doing very well and I think that is a great way to expand margins and so that strategy, that focus seems to be paying off. On the product side 58% I think that is not too dissimilar to what we have seen in the fairly recent past and there were couple of things that actually impacted that and I think I pointed these out, one would be the port of Oakland strike and so we had the fly in some inventory and it is short term issue and it caused more to flight and then ship it by board obviously and then the second piece of it was the increase in price of the bundles. And that is just an accounting thing where the overall billings probably get I think it is little too early to say there was a tailwind this quarter perhaps next quarter, the quarter after that but from an accounting perspective you’re now attributing a little more to the subscription which causes little more of the billings to be deferred and so that drags down the revenue slightly. I think we have said a couple of million dollars and then a little bit extra cost from the port of Oakland strike and that hits the margin kind of all once in one quarter.
Andrew Del Matto: No we price in USD, U.S. dollars and then we have costs in local currency and so that is primarily from Euros.
Andrew Del Matto: Yes revenues and dollars are consistent and there is no change and then your cost are in Euros and there is obviously favorable benefit.
Andrew Del Matto: Okay. We are just seeing a hot security market, I don’t think there is any other way to characterize that the market there because clearly there is a headwind there, we bill in dollars which you would think would typically be a challenge but I think security has just become paramount and so we are just really not seeing we can’t say we’re seeing much of an impact once in a while we will hear something, somebody might say that the price is challenging or something like that but we seem to be working through those and it’s a lot less than you would expect.
Andrew Del Matto: And then Jeff just to add on I think raises a good point, we view ourselves as a market disruptor in our price performance and if you look at the NSS lab test, we tend to be in the upper right quadrant because the correlating security effectiveness which we perform at the highest level it is price per bit protected and are gigabit protected and we do very well. And so I think in the phase - when you look at us versus competitors, we still come across as a very effective solution both from security, from a security performance enterprise perspective.
Andrew Del Matto: Yes and Jeff, I know the question was to Ken but I can't resist adding on - I think what’s different is that, I mean all the breaches, all the headline events, I think have been a game changer for everyone over the last year and probably looking forward. I mean a year ago we’re talking about target, we get on to talking about some consumer breaches, maybe the Apple event and now we here we will forward to anthem and TV monitor for instance. And you’ve got President Obama, talking about terrorism and I think its hard to ignore, without I want to seem over height but its hard to ignore, its hard for corporations to ignore that because it now goes to their brand that I think one of the game changers clearly as that they now know they’re more cyber security is more about then protecting their own assets they have to be stewards of consumer or customer data. And that goes to their brand and then obviously the whole cyber terrorism thing. Whoever that might not impact everybody but its, it creates a lot of attention on the space and I think that attention transcends into the, to the board level and the sea level and people are concerned about it, want to understand it, want to understand what their risks are, and want multilayers of security to picks and I think that just creates a huge tailwind a fact the probably hasn’t existed in the past at the enterprise corporate level let’s say. I think that’s been there in the consumer level, if you go back in history but I think its more unique or more profound today at the corporate level than ever.
Andrew Del Matto: Yes. And I think, if you go back to keep for Michael I think we saw more above, I think I would characterize Q1 to be displacing incumbents, I would not, there certainly was some expansion for sure, I think we mentioned that, that’s definitely there, that’s definitely part of our final and part of strategy. I would call it more of a timing thing, I thing Q1 just totaled probably little more towards new customers.
Andrew Del Matto: No, I would stick to what I said last, I mean I actually said 20 to 30 Michael, and you said 25, was 25 a good numbers and I think, I agreed with you, so I'll stick with that. And then as far as CapEx goes, we’re sticking to the 40 to 45 range for the year.
Andrew Del Matto: No, nothing, nothing else, we’re very focused on to be fair, I think if you look at our model, because I do think there is a bit of a disconnecting the accelerated level of growth, certainly as you, you go north of 30%, the P&L becomes bit disconnected from the sales activity which we reflected more in billings. And now even more so in deferred revenue and then cash flow and so we very focused on ensuring we do everything we can around free cash flow for instance and, that might be like working capital for instance and just being very focused that were not, we’re not consuming more cash then we need to.
Andrew Del Matto: Sure, so qualitatively you can see the compression of our margins reflected and as reflected by the 14%, guidance and I think the performance in Q1 which is little better than we guided and then Q2. And so it is a significant investment in terms of headcount, we don’t share the number of headcount but its certainly a significant focus. In terms of the payback if you will or the time to kind of closing deal, I think you to really get rolling there probably takes, close to a year. I would say this though, early returns are very good. We closed what we believe is one of our largest healthcare deals as we mentioned in the script ever, one of our largest healthcare deals ever, we closed several federal deals, which were sizable.  And I think we’re looking very good in the financial services area, little early there but, from what we can see and we look at our milestones there, we feel like we’re hitting all of those are, the other thing I would mention, we are very, we tend to look at the funnel quite a bit, I used that as a metric to kind of gauge the - be a good barometer of the forward business. And that looks great as well as the productivity whether you’re looking at the funnel based productivity or looking at the actual, people seem to be ramping better than the historically have here and I attributed that to the marketing investments we’re making, I think that’s going very well and then also I think the way we onboard people particularly in the enterprise is very good. We have seasoned professionals with proven track records coming in, not only with their own book of business or relationships if you will, but they’re very good in onboarding people and building teams and I think we are seeing the benefit of that, we certainly hope you could see that over the next year in those verticals specifically.
Andrew Del Matto: Hi Jim the way I would like to answer the question is maybe just talking about our capital strategy and our capital strategy has been to invest for growth that’s largely been in sales and marketing over the last year or so, year and half I guess. And from what we could see that is the best return that we can give, I think you could see the growth in the top line and I also just we have share holders and investors and I think it is also falling through to the share price. So either from a return on capital perspective, we think that is a great investment, in terms of inorganic we constantly look out there, what are the challenging things is that security gets a lot of attention and so you’re looking at some very high multiples and we’re very disciplined on price and strategy and we want to look to things that can enrich our offerings over time but be accretive certainly over the shorter or near term because those are the things that tend to make sense. So we continue to evaluate, I am sure we will do something at some point kind of hard to predict that timing but we are going to be very disciplined in how and where we look and we have to be very consistent with our strategy and enrich value for our customers over time.
Andrew Del Matto: Yes fair Aaron. I don’t think you’ve seen I mean it is hard to predict. I say Q1 is often a little bit lower product revenue mix wise I think than Q4, so if you are looking at sequentially I think there is always a bit of a step down to simply because keep such powerful spend out quarter for purchases from a calendar perspective for enterprises and companies as a whole. And so I think you get a bit of that in Q1, look I think it’s certainly part of our strategy to enrich the subscriptions and charge more and build out decline, I think it is a little early to claim too much of a victory there quite honestly but I think mathematically if you just look at the accelerated pace as a natural fact you are just going to as you model it, you are going to end up deferring a little more because the mix, the lot of the growth ends up just falling into deferred revenue if you will being attributed to FortiCare and FortiGuard subscription services.
Andrew Del Matto: No, I think we talk about our customer retention rate which is just the overall number of customers renewing and that is north of 90%, so that is good, I don’t think we’ve seen anything overall, I think we I honestly I just think we’re executing very well.
Andrew Del Matto: Well Jayson I think the last comment is probably the way to look at I think people are ramping better than expected I attributed to - I think we’re very good at who we hire where we found our right profile if you will of experienced sales leaders and I think they’re bringing in their teams whether it’s team from their historical relationships or just how they onboard people. I think we’re also getting the marketing right in terms of how we generate leads for them and then also how we onboard them and how they deliver our message I think that’s just getting a lot better. And people are - sales people are getting the productivity faster than they had historically. I think it’s a combination of those things. Now talking about people who were hired, I don’t really look at people who are hired in December and how they performed in March don't speak, I think that’s just too early in fact you look more at their funnel and are they developing well enough such that they’re doing their job so to speak. And all those things look fine and that's it. I just think people are executing very well overall due to good leadership, good products, good marketing and good onboarding.
Andrew Del Matto: Yes, and Rohit, hopefully I’m being appropriately factual in terms of how I characterize a quarter. The guidance - we’ve given the guidance and I don’t obviously we wouldn’t want to expand on that too much. What I would say is that’s, what I expressed in the past is that, on the good side, I think the positive things are that we seem to be ramping very nicely, the marketing investments seem to be paying off, the people seem to be performing very well. I think our messaging resonates not only from the NSS labs tests that we referenced but just from a, the notion of best-of-breed integrated platform, I think also resonates very well at the enterprise level. I think on the cautious side, look we’re getting into bigger numbers, the compares are getting bigger year-on-year, we do have a lot of new people, and new processes in place and, I think we're being very appropriate in how we guide.
Andrew Del Matto: Scott, I think we were about, I would say midway in our overall sales and marketing investments, I would call, I would characterize it as mid way. Verticals is the major component of that, I think we're through quite a bit of that part of the strategy from a sales capacity perspective but now we're layering in marketing, we're layering in the marketing side of that and so that, that’s a bit of a an investment. The other investments we're making again are just investments continuing to scale the enterprise sales force globally and particularly in emerging markets and then also little bit in Asia where we probably have and invested as much as we would have liked, and you can see the results in Asia aren't quite keeping pace with the EMEA or the America’s and so that’s where we see the opportunity. I know it’s a little broader answer but when I think about the margin I just think its, I think its, you really want to take a step back and look at the whole frame if you will. I would say and just in particular with verticals again it takes a little while to have that investment payoff, you’re talking about bigger customers, lighthouse customers and each of those verticals. We saw a nice uptick in healthcare on one of the largest healthcare deals we’ve ever closed and then some very nice traction in the federal space, where we closed several deals.
Andrew Del Matto: I think I share the price of bundles, I would characterize roughly a couple of million dollars. As far as the Port of Oakland, yes somewhere maybe somewhere slightly north of 300 to 500 K, kind of in the 300 to 500 K range.
Andrew Del Matto: Some of that carries into inventory still the way you do the accounting in some of the cost of the freight actually rolls into the inventory balance and so you pay for it over time let's just say.
Ken Xie: We see deals both we placed in some of the current solution which they bought few years ago and also adding additional layer to protect internal server. So that, as mentioned now the network security space changing from the multifunction to the multilayer prevention right now. So we see especially a lot of large enterprise see the importance of deploy some network security inside the company to protect their server and their department.
Ken Xie: I think both, we started building some vertical team like to mention in like finance service and healthcare. So we can see a lot of new winning in this area but also the product also we're keeping improving. So a lot of new product now covered by the MP6 which is much faster chip and to help and deploy in the high speed environment now.
Ken Xie: I think there is few in the probably in the mid of refresh cycle to upgrade from the old like a single function or intuition box but this is the multifunction box was a connection firewall UTM. So that's and to say today probably majority enterprise do not quite update to this new generation yet. So that is going and same time and also we see the new opportunity especially in the large enterprise for the multilayer protection and also the opportunity in the service provider in the carrier to offer the clean pipe to secure the mobile device. So we see like a multiple trend and multiple opportunity to grow in this area right now and like to mention security now becomes highest priority for the management, for the board and is the market, is the space, like in my 20 plus years this is probably the hardest time to do the network security right now.
Ken Xie: We see a lot of interest and the customer really like the FortiClient with this added ATP capability. So we have over 2 million user and for FortiClient we offer free download and then they pay for the supporting fee, pay for the service. Now we have the FortiClient linking with the FortiGate, with FortiSandbox, with FortiMail with some other appliance which mostly in the network side in the central office. So that’s where once you link all this end point with network device, with management all together, we are going to much better inadequate protection compared to some other end points related to isolated device themselves. So that's where we see a lot of customer who are interested in this approach and then give them better multiple layer of protection, especially a lot of our mobile device now they can protect together with the network side.
Ken Xie: This is Ken. I think it is a sweet different market, internal multilayer securities more apply for the enterprise campus there is really security department, different server within enterprise, some of servers in the data center but that is also little bit different than the data center security that’s where like we are working with some like Cloud service providers and data center more using like Chase based 5000 or some 100 gig interface, so that’s running security in the data center, sometime even deploy the product in virtual platform there. So out of five virtual platform including like VMware, Amazon, Microsoft and also it is all of the virtual platform there. So we do see that data center, virtual platform also ramp up quickly and then the branch office is the one especially in other retail space you can see they need have a box to cover all their branch need not only just security piece of that component but also even that communication, some of the Wi-Fi communication, even some of the voice communication. So that we also see ramp up very, very quickly because with this system-on-chips solution, we can offer the best TCO for the enterprise solution there.
Ken Xie: I see the data center still in early ramp up but is the enterprise, within enterprise campus that is the biggest piece and also that we also see ramp up very quickly, it is deploy there is a multilayered internal security because you can look on today’s press release the news that is testing so we have the product, they just position us the best intrusion prevention system and the same box also test last year as the best firewall and also the best firewall platform. Because when you deploy it inside enterprise you need to have the box capable to handle all type application because we see this is new opportunity within enterprise and multiple layer campus security.
Ken Xie: It is Ken. I feel Fortinet growth is more limit by the sales capacity and also execution because we have a much better product, when in product testing or beta, we win most of that and thus you can see whether in the carrier in the Fortune 100 enterprise whenever there is a beta testing and we have highest winning rate compared to competitor, once we have full capacity in Europe, in America few quarters ago you can see the results kind of ramp up very quickly, the symptom for some of the vertical space in U.S. that is where you match in and we believe we can have some work as result come in.
Ken Xie: I think some of the changing make increase up the network speed whether in the enterprise or in the home user, in the cloud or the keeping involving there and I think the most law still applies, so every 18, 24 months that the speed double, the, [indiscernible] semiconductor also double there, that's probably we're keep going there.  On other side I see - because a lot of applications that we move to the mobile device and also attack the threat come from like - passes more like they could connect attack that’s what the traditional firewall they can break the connection and the secured the company with the parameter firewall. Now pretty much all the time we move to this agent based attack which they don’t need up connection, they can just get into your smartphone, get into the compromised laptop, PC even the USB drive. And once they bring something inside which can bypass the parameter firewall, then a big trouble internally because internal networks all connect by the switch were high speed switch, which we don’t have the capability to go to the higher layer to review the content, the user application to secure and to server department. So that’s where once similar mobile device bring into the enterprise - compromise mobile device bring into the enterprise and then there is a huge security usually there. So that’s where we see - until we can address the mobile device security, which whether by multilayer protection, all have some endpoint solution to secure a mobile device and the same time secure a pipe, I mean the traffic, other mobile device, otherwise I see still security is still a big issue.
Ken Xie: So some area like we mentioned, we announced like last week that the 40 client now with - capability we see a lot of interest in that area, so we don’t have like 2 million user download the software, which it is not a big number compared to some other endpoint solution provider but also not small number which we also found out is a good user can actually benefit from connect endpoint with network together. So that is really the key we can integrate the endpoint with networking with amount of management together which have a much better protection for the overall inside enterprise.
Ken Xie: MP definitely kind of improving the network speed interface speed quickly, especially in the firewall encryption. CP is more improving on the intrusion, on some other - some other content scanning performance. So we’ll have a product come up in second half of the year leverage new CP, will be the CP9, probably the product announced in the second half of the year then we’ll give some details.
Ken Xie: Yes that’s where - that’s most supporting infrastructure, we do see the need of some combined infrastructure with the security together so that’s where offer like secured Wi-Fi instead of just the Wi-Fi connection there. So that's opportunity we see, because right now we’re using FortiGate as a Wi-Fi controller so that's definitely will help in the school handle not only the better infrastructure but also better security.
Ken Xie: This is Ken. I think that's a new area beyond the primary security for enterprise is that still, like I said still in early stage, but we do see the customer, large interest and also want to spend money to provide multilayer security because it also depend on platform to handle the speed of internal security because internal security tend to be like 100 even thousand times faster than the parameter, the board of security because internal is all connected by the high speed switch. So you need to have a high speed deployment and also have to be easily replacing some of the switch, has to be very quick and also lot of things now depend on the fixed policy but all depend on the some merchant lending, some behavior-based what's normal, what's abnormal traffic kind of pattern to really manage that. So as this is still early and but you can see from the large enterprise for all this - like they see the important of security servers, security datacenter, security department there. I don't see much – pretty much no research for some research firm to address this one yet and but I do believe this is relatively additional market and as a new opportunity, we position well, well because the platform we have with ASIC accelerate beyond the CPU, which can have huge advantage before internally in the high speed environment. That’s probably more - happen in the large enterprise right now and I think eventually they may expand into some mid enterprise even some data center service provider but is in early stage right now.
