Michelle Spolver: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on this conference call to discuss Fortinet's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2013. Joining me today are Ken Xie, Fortinet's Founder, President and CEO; and Ahmed Rubaie, our recently appointed CFO and COO. This is Ahmed's first conference call with Fortinet, and we welcome him to our company and look forward to his contributions as we work to execute against the company's strategic growth initiatives. In terms of the structure of the call, I will begin by providing a quick summary of our key first quarter financial metrics, then turn the call over to Ken who will provide perspective on the market and our business and product highlights. Ahmed will then review our operating results, along with some thoughts on our outlook for the second quarter and full-year 2013 before we open up the call for questions. As a reminder, we are holding 2 calls today. Given that we already covered some of the aspects of Q1 in our pre-announcement a few weeks ago, we're going to try and keep this first call to about an hour. For those who have additional or more detailed questions, we will hold a second conference call at 3:30 p.m. Pacific Time. Both calls will be webcast from our Investor Relations website and are -- will be accessible as detailed in our earnings release. Before we begin, let me first read this disclaimer.

Before I turn the call over to Ken to provide perspective on the market and Fortinet's product and business highlights, let me reiterate our Q1 financial highlights, all of which are consistent with the pre-announcement a few weeks ago. Specifically, billings were $148.5 million, increasing 8% year-over-year. Revenue was $135.8 million, up 16% over the prior year period. Non-GAAP operating margins were 18% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.10. And finally, our cash generation remained healthy with $36 million of free cash flow during the quarter. In a few minutes, Ahmed will provide additional financial and operational details, but first, let me now turn the call over to Ken.
Michelle Spolver: I don't think on the pre call that we talked about sales management challenges. We talked about in Latin America that we had a lot of hiring that was happening there, and that we did acknowledge there was a change in management in the U.S. for our America sales, but I don't believe we talked about management challenges.
Michelle Spolver: Q2 was a tough comp. The growth there was 32%, which is close to double what we would normally grow at.
Michelle Spolver: I'm going to let Ahmed take most of it, but let me at least address the federal. We don't that is our vertical breakdown is worldwide numbers, so it's all government worldwide. We don't break out and never have broken out federal.
Michelle Spolver: Yes, I mean, just to clarify though, in the pre announcement call, we did not say that deals have already any of those deals had already closed back. Let's go back to what we said a few weeks ago. We said based on what we knew at the time, those deals hadn't been lost, just for clarification.
Michelle Spolver: Yes, I think that's you were saying services or subscription attach rate. In general, to go from Ken's point, is we don't break out by sector, but it's not all that different. In general, it's about 80% of the people who buy our FortiGate products buy them with subscriptions, so roughly 20% or so firewall only. I think most of it, it depends on how it's deployed. When most of our service provider deals are for those companies using our systems to provide managed security services. A lot of those times, they're using it with our bundled subscriptions. Where we see firewall only deployments most often are large enterprises.
Michelle Spolver: Yes, your first part, we forgot to address it. That was about ASPs. I mean, in general, it depends on how that really, we don't give out the ASPs, but the product mix shift really depends on the type of products that are sold within that quarter. So it changes a bit quarter to quarter. Service providers tend to, not always, but tend to buy the higher end products, unless its a CPE based deployment. And in that type of instance, they'll buy a few very, very high end products, and then it could be hundreds or thousands or more of low end products. So that could alter the product mix or ASPs.
Ahmed Rubaie: Yes. Thanks for the question, Keith. I think for the time being, and again, mind you, and I'll let Ken add or subtract, being a week on the job and having seen where other companies where enterprise is at large, I would give you the following color. In where we sit today, on April 30, things are pretty much the same relative to what we saw in the first quarter. Now having said that, I've also given you some color that within the U.S. provider space, we still feel very strong. From a competitive perspective, we're still winning deals. The point is that there are lesser of them and that the buying behavior where somebody might be willing to extract a large deal a quarter ago, they're looking at lesser buying capacity over coming months. I think until that changes, we probably will stick to that. And the full year guidance does take that into consideration, with some acceleration obviously in the back end of the year as more related to our historical performance in Q4 being our largest quarter.
Ahmed Rubaie: Keith, just to give you a little more color on that, perhaps the other point I wasn't obviously on the pre announcement call, but I did read the script. The other change is the fact that I'm walking in also as Chief Operating Officer. So part of the reason for joining is to help out on many fronts in the operations. Obviously, it'll take time to both learn the business as well as try to figure out optimal solutions, so that we have a foundation to grow this business to its potential scale. So part of the answer to your question is, as I ramp up and learn the business, I'll be a little more conversant on what it is we're doing and helping across both the operating aspects and the challenges we had we saw in Q1, but as we face other challenges going forward.
Ahmed Rubaie: Okay, let me take that, Sterling. Long time no hear. So in terms of where we are 2 weeks after the pre announcement having analyzed the data, it's actually a mixed bag of fact patterns. But the overall the overarching answer to your question is the general softening in the economy is causing a mixed bag of behaviors. Some are delaying, some are buying less, some are dividing their purchasing capacity over time. So I think, until further notice, we're going to make the assumption that it'll continue to be that way in the current quarter, and we're laser focused because, as Ken pointed out, it is a competitive differentiating area in terms of what we can do for the larger enterprises. And I can also tell you that in my first week on the job, believe it or not, I did find time to go out and talk to a couple of customers that fit that category. And it's abundantly clear to me that this is really more macro and we do stand out, and the positioning of our growth in this area will pay off in due time.
Ahmed Rubaie: Yes, so I would say, Sterling, in respect to Q2, I would stick to the ranges I gave. And obviously, the midpoint is the safest bet. And as you know, much like where you and I have worked in the past, it's pretty back end loaded. So we will not know anymore color really until the end of the quarter. But I certainly would not go above and beyond the range because it really is a continuation of what we saw from Q1.
Ahmed Rubaie: That's a good question, Brent, and thanks. So the way I would look at it, I would extrapolate from what we learned in Q1. And that is, there was an element of lesser larger deals, which, as you know, is predominantly out of the U.S. provider market but service provider market, that is. But similarly in Europe, we saw more conservative buying behavior. So it's not really so much about segmentation as it is about less larger deals, more conservative buying behavior in Europe, and some of it is also here in the U.S. In terms of Latin America, as you've seen with other companies, it's a bit sluggish and volatile. One day up, one day down. For now, we're staying the course in terms of what we saw in Q1. And obviously we remain very optimistic on our business in APAC. So it's really more about the geographies, the macro impact than it is about segmentation.
Ahmed Rubaie: I think as a team, we do. To be frank, Brent, in 1 week on the job, I still have more diligence myself to get into. So I will as we get to know each over time, I'll be more conversant. But we have action plans in place, and I plan to dive deep into those issues to make sure we're mitigating, not only for the current quarter, but that we have a process to mitigate going forward because we're scaling the business.
Ahmed Rubaie: Yes. So let me cover the segments for you first. The service provider was 25%; government, 13%; retail, 11%; financial services, 9%; and education, 6%.
Ahmed Rubaie: Tom, another way to cut at your question and I fully understand your question. I don't have the depth in terms of the historical numbers. But I can tell you, having studied the company a fair bit before joining it, is to also look at how much the addressable market has grown over that same time period and our differentiated position against that addressable market, is another way to look at it. And overall, as you look at the world where I come from, the cloud world and other areas, the UTM market is clearly going to be in demand and in more demand as time goes on. So the cyclicality piece you're referring to, if anything, these are temporary blips based on everything we know right now, and they should correct. In terms of actual raw numbers and comps that Ken and Michelle were giving you, at the end of the day, that's what I was trying to allude to in my comments, larger deals last year have actually made it a tougher comp in the current environment because we're seeing less larger deals. But we're seeing a lot more attractive deals at the same time. It's just the number of larger deals slowed down in Q1, and we expect it to be the same in Q2.
Ahmed Rubaie: I think that's right. I think if you're trying to reconcile the guidance on the free cash flow, it's more commensurate with the decrease in billings. So billings have gone down, and in turn, I took the guidance down on free cash flow. In terms of the technology upgrade and the building, it's too early now. But as I get my feet more wet in the business, I'll be more conversant with numbers in future quarters.
Ahmed Rubaie: No, it's not so much about payment terms. I think what Ken was alluding to, and I know you guys discussed it in the pre announcement call as well, is the notion in these large enterprises where CFOs may have been easily signing checks for larger deals, they're signing lesser checks until they see the macro change for their own business. So it's really more in that context versus payment terms and collecting it upfront and later, if that makes sense.
Ahmed Rubaie: We're in the middle of the course. I can't comment on current deals. And as you know, we're back end loaded. These things happen when the macro shifts, people look at all sorts of different things. But for the time being, as you can tell from our receivables, our DSOs, all the other metrics, cash included, we didn't see an impact of that in the first quarter. So in our case, I would assume business as usual until we tell you otherwise.
Ahmed Rubaie: I think the question, I apologize, is premature. I think you need to give me some time to learn the business and get a better handle on the business model and where we're going prospectively. I think for the current year, you should assume the numbers we've given you. As I get to know the business better, we'll consider giving you guys more longer term targets that are also commensurate with our strategic plan and where we want to take the business.
Ahmed Rubaie: Well, so as customary, we don't talk about deals within the quarter. And I think it also because, as you know, customarily that most of the deals close in the last couple weeks of the quarter. Here's what I will tell you. I think what we've learned since the pre announcement is, it's the same logic I gave earlier, that a lot of this is actually tied to the macro and the ability to write checks at those companies. So our current guidance for Q2 assumes our best capability in the current quarter in terms of sales delivery. And I answered the question earlier that the midpoint is where I would hang my hat. So there really isn't any more color to give you at this point.
Ahmed Rubaie: I think that's exactly right. So when you look at the bellwethers in Latin America, Brazil has been up and down over the last several quarters. So we saw an element of that. And to Ken's point, there were some geopolitical issues, while smaller in number, also impacted. And our internal bit was focusing on the growth. And we're on top of that. That's one of the areas that I'm actually personally working on, having lived in Latin America in the past, to make sure that we're going about the market with all the investments that we've made to date. So we're excited about what Latin America may still bring in coming quarters.
Ahmed Rubaie: Sure. I appreciate the question. Look, from my perspective, obviously, with 1 week on the job, the best illustration I can give you is drinking out of a firehose. And those of you that have interacted with me know that I dig deep into the business and learn as much as I can. And so it's going to take me some time to ramp up in terms of an understanding of our products, where we are. And I also plan to spend a lot of time at customers, with our engineers, and connecting all the dots from product to commercial commercialization of our products. So having said that, what can I tell you after the first week? Look, I joined this company for a reason. As most of you know, we sold Ariba back in October, and I've been very selective. I picked Fortinet because it has an advantage product, and that is most important. So the fact that there was a pre announcement, the fact that there's a bit of a softening in the macro at the moment is really neither here nor there. We're well positioned, and I have the conviction that that's where we're going. We obviously have some internal challenges that come along with growing any business, and that's why I call them growing pains. But those of you that have interacted with me in the past know that I've gone through all of that. So I would summarize it as follows: I'm going to spend a lot of time learning. Even in my first week, as I mentioned, I've gotten out to customers, and I really appreciate Ken and the team taking me in. And there's going to be a lot of mentoring and teaching in coming weeks until I really figure out where things are, where the bathroom is and so on. But once we get past that, I'll be a little more conversant on where we're going prospectively. In terms of the strategy, I think the strategy is pretty obvious. Look, the product is advantaged in one particular context, and that is, it can do more with higher performance, far more reliable, far more scalable. So having just graduated from a cloud business, having been in other businesses, these are ever increasing areas of demand for companies to reckon with, of all sizes, across all verticals and across all geographies. And so while Q1 was soft, Q2 continues to be soft, we did see a handsome uptick in APAC as an example. And that is terrific validation also. And in a very large wireless company, as I talked about earlier. So the strategy is growth, both organic and inorganic. The company's history to date is we've looked at technology enhancements to add to our portfolio of products. You have as you know, this is all public information, the number of patents is very impressive at this company. And so we will work together as a team to keep growing this company. And as I indicated earlier, have the agility to pull back if we ever need to. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color, at least at a high level.
Ahmed Rubaie: Right, right. So I think it was both, tops down and bottoms up, as well as qualitative input from customers, as well as other external market data. So we went about it from all angles, and feel very comfortable that we understand what took place in Q1. Also feel very comfortable that this is not about conservatism. This is just reality. What we saw in Q1 continues on in Q2. And we've got our fingers crossed, all pedals pushed to generate what we need to in Q2. And as you know, we will not see that until the last couple of weeks of the quarter. Extrapolating that into the last the latter part of the year, we took a little bit of both all the angles I described to you, plus the fact that we've been making investments all along for several quarters. So we're expecting some ramp up to come in and help out later in the latter part of the year.
Ahmed Rubaie: Thanks, everybody. And for those of you that have more detailed questions, we look forward to talking to you at 3:30. And again, we appreciate your continued confidence in Fortinet. I look forward to working with all of you.
Ken Xie: Keith, I think -- I believe the service provider is long-term wise still is a great space to be because you can see the press release we made yesterday is a joint release with Hughes Network. So that's where the joint solutions is really have the service provider offer a lot of security service to their customer is one of the best way to manage security going forward. Because security, I think, are much more complicated and more difficult to manage just by the enterprise end user there. So that's where we believe is a good space and we are very -- I mean, at a much better position than other competitor in this space. And we'll continue keeping invest and is one of the -- long-term wise is one of the fast growing space going forward.
Ken Xie: Yes, the U.S. sales metric, we try to be more focused on the enterprise. That's we have the fast growing sector, like last year we grew 55%, so that's where we want to keep you less [ph] in the enterprise area. At the same time, we started hiring a lot of new sales people, which take about 9 to 12 months to ramp up. So that's where the area we mentioned in the prepared announcement.
Ken Xie: We have a great product and also the best team, so that's why we feel it's long term why we're in the best position in the space.
Ken Xie: To answer some of your growth questions. I think it was last year this time, we involving one of the bigger deals, which can help in the growth. I think last year at this time, I mean Q1, probably growth, I think 30 some%.
Ken Xie: Yes, that's helped in by one of the deal. Right now at the forecast we have not considered any major deal yet. But I think, going forward, once the new team in the position ramp up, we do see some potentials.
Ken Xie: I think, it's more macro and also on the service provider, like I mentioned, some of the buying pattern changed and come from like kind of CapEx to OpEx kind of behavior. But I think, long term, with all the space, including the service provider, the [indiscernible] enterprise is also pretty strong. And we see the fast growing in the enterprise sector, so that's where, last year Q1, that's the strongest growing areas in enterprise.
Ken Xie: No, not in the professionals. Professional is a pretty small part of it. So that's where I think, probably more relate to the what was the...
Ken Xie: We're still about 1 year away from the facility. I think it's a little bit too early to give the forecast right now.
Ken Xie: Probably towards the end of year, we probably will be. But we need to reserve some of that because both are big spending there.
Ken Xie: Yes, I think the market growing from IDC's forecast about 6% gone probably about 10%. We still growing almost double the market growing rate, so we're still keeping gaining market share there.
Ken Xie: Yes, and also we feel the best use of the cash will be investing in the business, so that's where we feel the long term model will be keeping reasonable profit, but also investing the growth keeping gaining market share and also investing in the technology. So that's where probably the model, I think about 27%, maybe a little bit higher, we would rather invest in the growth, so that's where we feel will be a better long term position compared to make a lot of profit.
Ken Xie: The Coyote Point product, probably more towards the second half of the year. So will take some time because we it's more acquire the technology, the team and then long term product integration. But right now we just want to take some time to gradually integrate.
Ken Xie: I think probably a little bit of both. I don't think it was execution. We hired some people, which also take some effort, and also they need some time to ramp up. And on the other side also, there's some like macro environment challenge there in a few countries in Latin America. And that also impact some number.
Ken Xie: I think we not quite gave the specific sector renewal rate. But we our renewal rate is above or high, consider we're tracking the renewal based on the product, not based on the customer. So the current renewal rate is in the higher 70%. If you look in the on the average life of the product in the customer hand, probably average about 4 years. So that's probably more like a high 90% of renewal if you kind of do some kind of math there. So that's where the I think, that the service provider probably similar to that, we don't see much difference.
