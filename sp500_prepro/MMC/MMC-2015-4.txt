Daniel S. Glaser: Sure. Thanks, Ryan. Actually, in terms of how we get close to our long-term target and, in fact, achieve it over the long term, there's no magic formula. It has basically, obviously, top-line growth is a significant factor. And the more we grow the top line, the easier it is to expand margins. Although we have proven our ability to expand margins even in times of pretty low organic growth. We feel very comfortable that when you look over the last number of years how we have grown in the 3% to 5% organic growth area that for 2016, the way it feels like to us is that we'll be in that range and we will have margin expansion in both segments and, therefore, our operating earnings will be quite strong. And fundamentally that is the backbone to how we will deliver EPS growth. So, there's nothing in our current thinking of it that involves issues like tax, et cetera. The one thing we don't control is FX. We don't control the macroeconomic conditions in the world either, but we're less concerned about that because that sort of has a lag factor. But FX hits you between the eyes in any one quarter and in any one year. But if you look at our results, even in 2015 on a constant currency basis, it was very strong and we would expect that to continue in 2016.
Daniel S. Glaser: Yeah. So, I think, from where we sit today, I mean, we'll know more as the year progresses. But from where we sit today, if you look at Guy Carpenter's performance in 2015, it's probably the best indication of the full-year performance as to what we would expect in 2016 as well.
Daniel S. Glaser: So it's certainly a potential positive. It takes a while to turn up, I would say. So, we haven't seen anything and we very rarely actually compete with PE. I know plenty of people do, but ultimately our general attitude with regard to acquisitions is we very rarely, if at all, participate in auctions and, if PE is involved, we almost always take a pass because we want the owners to have made up their mind as to whether they want to be part of Marsh & McLennan Companies, part of a strategic long-term viable operation or whether they're looking to optimize compensation in the short term and they're willing to roll the dice as to what the ultimate outcome and the ultimate owner someday down the road would be. And so we don't bump up against PE as much as you would think.
Daniel S. Glaser: Okay. Well, that's fine. That's probably a record. But I would just like to thank everybody for joining us this morning and thank our colleagues specifically for their support and our clients for all the good things that we do together and wish everybody a good day. Thank you very much.
Peter Zaffino: Thanks, Dan. As Dan said, that this has always been a well thought-out strategy. We like the segment in the middle market and it has been one that we wanted to grow in through acquisition and through organic growth. We've been able to attract the highest quality agencies in building MMA. And attributes of high-quality agencies are terrific people, track records of strong organic growth and they've been able to do that once we've acquired them. Then we have shared best practices across those high-quality agencies, and so that quality has led to more quality. A big part of the organic growth, though, is not only have we acquired high-quality agencies, we've invested a lot of in our sales capacity. And so we're trying to grow net sales capacity each and every year. We now have over 700 full-time producers within MMA and that makes a very big difference. And then lastly is that Dave Eslick and his leadership team have executed very well. So, not only are we growing the segment that's strategically where we wanted to be in, attracting the highest quality agencies, we're also investing in executing on sales capacity. And so the growth has been balanced across the U.S. and balanced between the H&V (34:57) and Property and Casualty.
Peter Zaffino: There's not a lot to add, Dan. I think you captured a lot of it. I think what we've seen in the pricing has been â€“ we've seen more falloff in 2015 compared to 2014. But the sequential from quarter to quarter we have not seen accelerate. So, we have seen more rate come off in 2015 in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And so we would expect that in 2016, it will be modest. I don't see it significantly accelerating. We've seen property come off a little bit more, but it's been very orderly, very measured, and we think it would be a balance. In terms of how you should think about commission versus fee, we've mentioned that we're growing a lot in MMA, and so the commission we'll book is growing as a overall percentage of the book, not only from organic growth but as we're making more acquisitions, and then the international is driven more by commission.
Peter Zaffino: We had a terrific fourth quarter. 13% was led by Peru, Mexico and Colombia. So, those are three out of the four top countries in terms of size in Latin America. We did have a weaker fourth quarter in 2014. So perhaps the growth is a little bit more than perhaps the run rate. We did 8% for the year. But if I look at the fundamentals, we had really strong client retention, very good renewal growth from the rollover of new business in the prior year. But, again, strong client retention, and we grew through new business. So, they really executed on a balanced basis and really pleased with the recovery for the year. And as Dan said, it's been six straight years with 8% or greater. And we just have a terrific business there.
