Donald Brandt: Yes, so that’s one driver and it's really driven by the fact that we expect more of construction work progress in 2018 over 2017. But I think what’s also being masked is an electric gross margin where the big downward estimate was due to tax reform. But also we show higher retail revenue in there as well. We finished the year at 1.9% customer growth 1.8 for the year so we’re seeing continued improvement in that economy and although we did not change the O&M range we expect to have lower O&M in 2018.
Donald Brandt: I think it’s due to higher sales we expect 1.5% to 1% to 1.5% in 2018 and we are seeing higher realized prices in the last half of 2017.
Donald Brandt: So the big drivers really on the distribution side and that’s really driven by a modernization of the grid reliability and then really growth. We have 21 new substations planned over the next three year so that’s a sign of preparing for future growth as well. So those are the big drivers.
Donald Brandt: Yes, we continue to talk with customer like the City of Phoenix with a micro-grid at the airport thanks for that nature but none of that’s been here because we did not have specific projects. So incrementally maybe a little upside but I think it reflects our best thinking as of now.
Donald Brandt: Not at this time. We're in an A minus we have a very pristine balance sheet, strong FFO to debt and so we’re not looking or planning on equity at this time.
