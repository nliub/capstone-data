John Strangfeld: Thank you, Eric. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We had a strong and eventful first quarter. Our earnings per share for the quarter increased 17% from last year's first quarter based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services business. We produced an annualized ROE of 11.4% for the quarter on the same basis. GAAP book value per share reached $63.50, up 16% from a year ago. In a few moments, Rich and Mark will review the quarter with you in detail.  In brief, our financial results are solid and broadly based, and our sales and flows demonstrate excellent and continuing commercial momentum. In our Annuities business, our competitive position and expanding distribution have driven strong sales and flows, leading to substantial growth of business with attractive returns. In Asset Management, we are benefiting from higher fees driven by growth in Assets Under Management, as well as the absence of significant credit-related charges, which affected results a year ago. In our U.S. Protection businesses, results were down modestly from last year, reflecting less favorable group disability claims experienced in the current quarter. Our international businesses are producing sustained organic growth, including an increasing contribution from Life Insurance Protection business sold through the bank channel at Gibraltar Life. Current quarter results also include the first month of operations at the Star and Edison businesses we acquired in February. The addition of these companies will significantly strengthen our franchise in Japan, where we are already a market-leading farm life insurer. In spite of the earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan, business integration is proceeding well, in line with expectations, and with no material surprises. We applaud our dedicated staff in Japan, as well as our associates in the U.S., who have kept us on track through this difficult period. Largely because of recent increases in Japanese and U.S. interest rates, our estimation of the earnings contribution over time of Star and Edison is modestly higher than our earlier expectations. In April, we reached agreement to sell our Global Commodities business in a transaction that is expected to close later this year. When completed, this transaction will free for redeployment approximately $400 million in capital. Broadly, on the subject of capital, we are at a very strong position, with both capacity and flexibility in capital deployment. We are highly focused on capital management, and we recognize the importance of capital deployment in the achievement of our 2013 ROE aspiration of 13% to 14%. We look forward to a fulsome discussion of capital and capital management at our Investor Day next month. And with that, I will turn it over to Rich.
John Strangfeld: Well, Andrew, I think that falls in the category of capital management, capital deployment and our thinking around that, and that's a subject matter we're intending to focus a lot of time and attention on in June.
John Strangfeld: The other thing I'd add to that, John, just to jump in, is when Rich described what he did-- this is John -- we're not authoring our point of view regarding the economics of the outlook of Star/Edison in terms of its operating attributes. What we were describing earlier was the change associated with the different share assumption and associated with the [indiscernible]
Charles Lowrey: Andrew, it's Charlie Lowrey. In terms of HDI versus HD6, and what we expect in the second quarter, I think it's fair to say that sales will be lower than they were in the first quarter. We had a tremendous first quarter. But the second quarter, obviously, won't incorporate the surge that we had in the first quarter, which was about $1 billion. Secondly, HDI does have some different terms, and there's additional competition coming into the market, with product that tries to resemble our product, which we believe is kind of a corroboration of our approach, which we've been saying all along about the product we have in the marketplace. The last thing I'd say, and this is to the same quarter as well, is that we don't look at market share specifically. But what we do is to look at the profitability of our product going forward, and the market share falls out where it may. You've seen that in how we dealt with Individual Life, and you'll see that with how we deal with Annuities as well.
Charles Lowrey: It's an interesting question because within ITPICM, which is the line you're referring to, Investments, Transactions, Proprietary Investment and Capital Management, there will be a little bit of lumpiness by definition that, that occurs in this business. So there will be some volatility. What we've been trying to do over the course of the past couple of years is to lower the amplitude of that volatility as we go forward. So I don't think it's fair to say that you won't see any. But I think the degree of volatility you saw a couple of years ago has been significantly ameliorated, and that you will see less volatility as we go forward.
Charles Lowrey: I think so. In other words, if you look at the past few quarters, we've had foreclosures, sales of foreclosed assets, some of which have been positive, some of which have been slightly negative. But what that means is that we feel pretty good about the marks we have within the interim portfolio.
Charles Lowrey: I think the positive operating leverage just comes from the scale of which we're operating, and the profitability of the products. As I said earlier, we don't go after market share per se. What we really look at is risk-adjusted returns to us and obviously, providing good product to the customers. And I think as a result of that, we look at the profitability of the product, and we're pleased with that.
Charles Lowrey: Sure. Let me do that in terms of as we think about it, if it's okay with you, the return on equity. But the question really is, how do we think about the business. And we think about it in terms of 3 different cohorts. We have the legacy kind of non-algorithmic business. We then have the HD series or the legacy HD series, and then the HDI. And given the interest rate increases that have taken place, the increases in the equity markets and the decreases in the VIX or the volatility, we've been -- this has been a very good environment for us. So we're happy with the legacy business, and that's a non-algorithmic business, where we expect low to mid-teens returns on that business. We're very happy with the HD series, especially the surge business, where we expect to hit targeted returns of mid-to-high teens. And we're even happier with the HDI product that we're writing now, which is exceeding our return expectations.
Charles Lowrey: Sure. Well, this is the investment-only stable value product really, and it's more fee-based than spread-based. But this is the case, I think, where we have jumped into a vortex that was left when banks and some insurance companies left the market in terms of stable value. And we and a couple of other firms jumped in the business when we thought we could get very good risk-adjusted returns, and so we've taken a business from 0 to $23 billion in about 18 to 24 months. We entered a very good business, which has given the rates that we can charge, and that we think are appropriate, very good risk-adjusted returns for us that are accretive to ROE, substantially accretive to ROE.
Charles Lowrey: We're seeing discussion of former players come back in, but we really haven't seen a lot of those players come back in. I mean these were some of the investment banks, it was AIG, it was others. There's talk of some of them coming in, but we still see a very good deal flow.
Charles Lowrey: So in its current form, it wouldn't be viewed as being spendable, but it would be viewed as being a buffer. Over time, it converts from the one to the other.
Richard Carbone: Yes, Nigel, it's Rich. On Star/Edison, we can keep this really simple. Let's go back to when we announced the deal. We said we thought accretion in 2012 would be about 5%, driven off of a $0.40 EPS number. Today, now that we've finished our purchase accounting, there are 2 things that are different. One, you know about, we issued less shares and the second one, you also know, that rates went up. So there's less of a discount -- there's less of a premium on the bonds that we need to amortize. The impact of both of those 2 will give us about a $0.55 increase in EPS in 2012 or 7% accretion, again, based on -- and this is important, it was based upon the average street estimate for 2012 that was outstanding back there when we announced the deal. So $0.55, 7% accretion, 2012 versus 5% and $0.40 accretion in 2012. Let me add -- you also asked -- I'm going hand it over to Mark in a second, but Corporate and Other. Corporate and Other has got a lot of cats and dogs in it. This quarter may be a little high because we had some extra legal fees. We had some extra philanthropic activities, the tragic event in Japan. We donated $5 million for that. But if I was to moderate that a bit, it would be maybe $10 million, so the $272 million is down to $262 million. I don't think it's worth counting the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin here.
Richard Carbone: And the other part in there, the margin is going to expand because as the balances grow and the future profitability expectation increases, and you guys know this, it came back to drops, [ph] and DAC amortization reduces over time. So that will add to the margin expansion.
Richard Carbone: Yes, the $350 million of capital debt maturing in December, we will refinance that in December or prior. We may pre-refund it. We don't intend on paying that down, and you got -- you're right, it's about $850 million. In 2012, half of that is operating debt, and about half of that is capital debt. The capital debt will be refinanced, the operating debt, it depends upon the business conditions at the time. We are focused on the Moody's ratio, but we're not wedded to it. We're focused more on our cash flow capabilities at the holding company to service our debt, and to have a cushion against servicing all our debt.
Richard Carbone: We have made an application to the State Insurance Department for a $1.2 billion dividend, and we expect a piece of which is extraordinary, and a piece of which is ordinary. The ordinary is just by way of application. But the other one requires approval. We expect approval. That's $1.2 billion within the next couple of months.
Richard Carbone: Let me flip your terminology there, Ed. The total capital capacity is the $4 billion to $4.5 billion. The excess capital is the $2.2 billion to the $2.7 billion. That difference in between the number that you've thrown out, the 400%, and let's make believe, the 480%. Add those assets that are supporting that capital become cash, they're going to drop into the excess capital capacity. We're not holding 480%. So let me explain it by way of example. There are a couple of items that count in our statutory capital that are included in the calculation, and let's call the calculation the gross capital capacity. But they're not readily spendable or, said another way, the cash flows are not predictable. So because they're not predictable, we're not putting them into the excess capital number, but they're going to turn into cash. Some of these items are subject to -- also, some of them get volatile. They bounce around. The easiest example is the deferred tax asset. A benefit for RBC, but not immediately collectible in cash, but will turn into cash over time. As that asset turns into cash, and it gets monetized, it's going into the excess capital number. If we have none of that stuff above 400%, all of the capital above 400% is going in that $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion number.
Richard Carbone: The difference is not a buffer for stress scenarios. It is not intentional. It's just there now. And so if something happens, it's going to chew up the deferred -- the first thing it's going to chew up, it's going to chew up that sort of, I hate to use the word, the non-cash projections of capital above the 480%. It's not an intentional buffer. It's just coincidental at this point in time. If it goes away, and everything above that 400% is -- the cash flows are predictable, or all of the attributes above the 400%, that's going in the excess.
Richard Carbone: It's not being intentionally kept. If all of those DTAs [deferred tax asset] became cash and all of the DTAs got us to 400%, but above that was all cash assets, they're going in the excess capital of $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion, and bumping that up.
Richard Carbone: Well, that's part of the problem, right? Because the biggest piece being the DTA, okay, so we've got a deferred tax asset on the books, where did it come from? It came mainly from those book losses, the losses we took for book purposes in 2009, right? But they didn't hit the tax return. So we didn't get a real reduction from them yet. So we stuck up a DTA. As we sell those assets or there is bankruptcy, they will become tax deductions and that asset will monetize. We believed, up until now, the intrinsic value of those assets was greater than the market. So we didn't sell them. We can trigger that DTA, and get the cash when we know the intrinsic value and the market value are the same. So it's not going to be forever.
Richard Carbone: Let me let Ed talk about the synergies. But the lion's share of the onetime cost in the first quarter, which is why I am loathe to annualize them and Ed knows better than I, how are they going to come in, was the transaction costs. Now those transaction costs obviously go away, but they're going to get replaced by real integration costs, and Ed may have a better...
Richard Carbone: Just to say this one, [ph] John, I think that the real economic that you need to focus on is the improvement in the accretion from 5% to 7%. And Ed, maybe you want to talk about where the onetime costs are going to...
Richard Carbone: No. You can't because I was giving out all that information as of 12/31, 12/31/10. The original assumption that the difference -- the only difference I did was, that is -- I added the $400 million from Global Commodities. That is not an estimate for 3/31/2011. And you're correct in assuming that there was earnings and other stuff's happening.
Edward Spehar: Two questions. Rich, I appreciate the additional color on capital. But going back to the comments, when you talk about an excess capital number of $4 billion to $4.5 million, and then you talk about a spendable capital number of $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion, with the comment that the difference is the buffer for stress scenarios. The question is why isn't that then just considered a 480% RBC requirement, because what is the environment where you don't carry the buffer for stress scenarios? And if it is 480%, I mean, are you pricing your business based on a 480% RBC ratio, and then I have one follow-up.
Edward Spehar: I guess, Rich, to me, that's a very different explanation than saying the difference is a buffer for stress scenarios. I think that's a very different answer.
Edward Spehar: I mean just to follow-up, there's really no reason for you, if you believe that there's intrinsic value there, obviously, there's no reason to do anything until the cash piece is gone, correct? But I mean, the ability to turn the whole thing to cash if you want is -- it's there, if I'm understanding this correctly?.
