Bren D. Higgins - KLA: Well, Tim, we haven't published a new model so it's a little bit difficult for me to answer that in terms of different WFE levels. I mean, I think the way you have to work through that is, as I've said around the revenue performance from an operating margin perspective, I think we're operating a couple hundred basis points better than what we have published before. But the easiest way to model that is if you're talking about in nearer term, and I think it's important assumption, are we talking now or a year from now and so on? But if you're just thinking in nearer term a $40 billion environment, you'd have to think about process control intensity on that. And I think in calendar 2016, process control intensity was below 13 percentile, so somewhere between 13% and 14%. The mix of business would be a factor in that. Market share was Gartner just reported 51%. We've got internal objectives to gain share at least a point of share a year over the next few years so that's certainly a factor there. And then our service business, which is currently – would be somewhere around $800 million into calendar 2017. So if you put all that together with the operating margin, I suggest that I think you can probably work your way to an EPS result.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA: Yeah, Farhan. Thanks. It's a good question. So there is some acceleration, I would call it incremental investment. We think there are opportunities for us on the inspection side. Well, frankly, metrology side as well for driving more process control into 3D NAND. And so there are a number of efforts in the company that are focused on that. There is also work that we're doing to enable EUV development activities. And so there's work there. Finally, the industry has strengthened, certainly the company performance has strengthened. So there's some variable comp dynamics that are part of that. And so when you add it all up, it looks like it's about $20 million higher for the year than what I was suggesting back in January. But our outlook has strengthened as well. So I think if you look back January versus today, we're probably in excess of $200 million of incremental revenue to where we see things today. And so if you follow our traditional drop-through model of operating margin, it's an incremental $20 million or so on costs. So it fits our model and we see it as an opportunity to invest in some of these big opportunities, we think, that will help drive process control intensity into 2018 and 2019.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA: Well, so, C.J., it's Bren. I mean, as we look to calendar or we look at 7-nanometer, I mean, 7-nanometer has a full shrink. You're shrinking in the front-end. You also have your shrinking in back-end in transistor wiring. So we think that that coupled with the multi-patterning schemes, the process integration structures that customers are doing with these new materials in the back-end will create a number of process window challenges, we think, will be good for our business. As we move into 7-nanometer, we have a number of new products that'll come out that customers will be able to try to address some of these technology challenges but also drive cost of ownership. So I think process control intensity per wafer goes up somewhere in that 20-ish percent range or so. Obviously, the number of wafer starts ultimately over time and design starts will be a factor in that because lots of designs change how customers invest. But how we're looking at it now is I think that to Rick's earlier comments, I mean, reuse will be limited. And I think the new product introductions plus the technology road map will be a good driver for our business.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA: Well, the variable comp will adjust, right? So that's one factor that will play out as we move into 2018. I think the easiest way for you to think about modeling the company is back to the model that we had put out, we're targeting an operating margin level based on certain revenue targets. And we're exceeding the published model because of the strengths in gross margin, which we believe are sustainable. And so that's what's driving the outperformance. So as revenue grows, we will invest. And I think that as I outlined earlier, I think there's a lot of opportunities out there and so we'll invest in those. But we're committed to the operating model and that's how you got to think about it.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA: Yeah, Harlan, it's Bren, and thank you for the comment. It really is more of an all-of-the-above statement. Certainly, logic, foundry into the second half of the year has strengthened it terms of the shipment profile. And we certainly saw that versus where we were in January. So now it looks like it's up a little bit and it's been really filling out in the December quarter. So we feel pretty good about that. I think in China we continue to be surprised by the customer pull that we see from those customers, so that's a factor in it as well. But I think all segments right now are investing and are putting a lot of pressure on us in terms of quick delivery. So I think the good thing about the upside we're seeing is it's quick orders and quick deliveries which will enable us to drive some revenue performance in the second half. But that's basically what's driving it. And I think finally the only other thing is that the order profile, so you look at the backlog that we're bringing into the year, the order result March, what we expect to be a book-to-bill greater than 1 in June. So we've got a fair amount of sort of backlog or runway in terms of what we see coming and how to scale and plan the factory through the second half of the year.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA: Yeah. It's a good question and really, we're seeing benefit in a lot of places. I mean, we're seeing improving margin profiles in service, we're seeing improving margin profile across products. New product introduction execution has been very strong in terms of how you manage from transitioning from one product to another. And at these revenue levels, I think the scaling of our factory and the leverage that exists in that has all been good. So I don't envision a drop-off like you described. I mean, certainly, at these revenue levels, I think as I guided, I thought calendar 2017 was 62 plus or minus 50 basis points. I think we're probably at the higher end of that guidance range now as we look into next year. And I don't see anything on the horizon that suggests that this profile will change going forward. So we feel pretty good about it. And as I said earlier, I think what's driving how we're looking at our operating model and performance of various revenue levels is not so much about what we're spending, but how much more gross margin we think we're going to generate from our revenue.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA: So the only thing I'll add to that is that in our unpatterned inspection business, we had a record year in FY 2016 and we just had a record quarter in that business in the March quarter from an order perspective. Now some of that is 3D NAND because 3D NAND is driving unpatterned inspection. They basically use these tools to monitor the deposition equipment to ensure cleanliness and so on, but also the wafer activity is a part of that. And I think that's starting and we expect to see that growing a little bit over time here and it'll be a nice tailwind as we progress through this year.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA: Yeah. I think when you look across the year, our view on logic spending in 2017 versus 2016 is relatively flat, so I think it's a quarterly dynamic more than anything. So, yeah, I think it's just – we got orders that are going to get placed and numbers a little bit higher next quarter.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA: Well, when you look at our order profile, I mean, it was so what we saw in 2016 and what we expect to see in 2017 for the most part is foundry-centric. And so it was roughly 15% of foundry orders in 2016 and maybe 25% of foundry orders in 2017. I think what's interesting is while the memory investment from a shipment perspective is more of an 2018 and beyond dynamic, we are starting to see memory orders show up in the funnel. And so as we look, I'm not sure exactly when we'll see those orders booked, whether we'll see them booked in June or whether we will see them booked in September. But they are for shipments in early 2018. And so your question about progress on the facilities is a good one, and so far as we monitor that and we begin to staff up in anticipation of supporting these ramps, these are factories we watch pretty closely. But right now, there's a lot of activity there and we're chasing trying to hire people and ramp up to be able to support those customers in a pretty diverse fab footprint overall across the country.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA: Yeah, I think as Rick said, it's going pretty much according to plan. We revenued four tools in 2016, our plan is to revenue 8 to 10 tools in 2017. To Rick's point, they're seeded all over in multiple customers so across all the settlements. The other dynamic is driving Gen 5 besides the discovery opportunities where we compete more directly with (42:33) capabilities is that you're also seeing it deployed in EUV development situations too because it's used as a tool for radical verification when they print wafers and use the wafer results to calibrate pattern fidelity on the wafer or the reticle. So there's an additional use case there that we're encouraged by and we're in line with our plans. And I think by the end of calendar year 2017, we should have somewhere between, I don't know, 15 and 18 tools or so in the field fully installed. So we'll see how many we actually end up with revenue beyond the plan, I told you, but there's – they're out there and getting deployed, demonstrating value.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA: Market share, just only thing I'll add is market share tends to be stronger with those customers? And so what comes with that is, to Rick's point, the need for some additional support as we work through it. So we have applications engineers in fabs all around the world and they get deployed in these opportunities. And we think we benefit pretty well from the market position we have on the tools and these folks help the customers get value out of the tools.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Absolutely, Tim. I think the biggest issue associated with 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer is the number of design starts that there are that are ultimately going to land at 7-nanometer. And 7-nanometer is a much more significant node than what we saw with 20-nanometer going to 16-nanometer, so therefore we don't see reuse as being as significant, mainly because there's going to be such an expansion in the overall capacity. So we think that will drive our intensity and it'll be more like what we saw with the 28-nanometer node. When you combine 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, it'll look more like that. So we feel pretty good about how that is playing out. Not only that, you have multiple players in the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer race, so you've got broad industry support, a number of foundries all competing for that as there are increased starts.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Sure. I think that as you look out into 2018, what you see is that the investment timeframe that'll include work on the 5-nanometer, so as you get to later in the year, and then continued expansion in addition to additional capacity being brought on by the guys who aren't in the lead in the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, so that's really from the foundry standpoint. Memory, you have continued investment going on kind of across the board. And our process control intensity is strengthening in memory so we see continued drive from that. And, of course, we've all talked about the investment that's going on in China. So right now it looks pretty good and our customers are certainly excited about their prospects as we go forward.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Just add to that, Harlan, I think one of the things that changed in the last three months is we were anticipating but not convinced that there was going to be this broad support for the 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer across multiple customers. And we see a lot more evidence of that now, so that really has strengthened the foundry side of the equation, to Bren's point, driving all those things. So it was a good quarter from that regard.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Harlan, yes. So, I mean, the metrology side has been pretty healthy. The concern we had was actually on the other side and the defectivity side being lower intensity. And we're seeing that strengthen. And that's relatively early just due to the offerings that we have. But I think that was the area where we think there is more upside because of all of the work that people have to do to do disruptive tests. And as the complexity increases, there's more opportunity. So we do think the intensity goes up. And I think that if you look at planar, overall process control intensity for planar versus 3D, they're actually pretty comparable now and likely more upside to that as we go forward.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Well, we have ongoing conversations with them as they are – we're critical suppliers to them. And there has been levels of investment for technology capability on a routine basis. But we have seen expansion recently and 2017 looks like it's going to be a very good year overall relative to capacity in support of increased capacity demands. So that business is part of the strength that we're seeing.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Well, there's really two things. One, what we saw in the period you referred to where it was underperforming – where we underperformed, I think the other thing that happened in addition to the mix shifting quite fast toward memory. You also had a lot of reuse happening, so it was kind of a combination of factors that played against us. What we have now is expansion of capacity continuing in foundry. Foundry continues to be reasonably strong. Less reuse, more players in our memory process control intensity going up over time, and then some other factors like the last conversation we just had like the OEMs and the wafer manufacturers investing. So really a broad customer base. On top of all that, we have China, where the process control intensity tends to be higher overall because these are smaller projects. So we have a lot of factors working in our favor that are supportive of our revenue growth performance.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Not agnostic. We have a much higher percentage of adoption in foundry than we do in memory. But unless there is a major shift in terms of the relative performance, we believe we'll continue to perform in line or better than the industry as we go forward.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Yeah. Sure. I mean, any time there is any kind of shrink going on, there tends to be increased demand for, especially in the wafer side, wafer inspection side for finding smaller defects. So that will drive it. But you're talking about a relatively small part of our overall market. So you wouldn't see as big a change as you would in a node shift down to 7-nanometer, for example, if that makes sense. But sure, any of those trends are good, and especially when the fabs – from our standpoint, if it's the smaller fab doing it, the relative process control intensity is higher just because of where they are on the yield curve and on the volume curve, if that makes sense.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: I certainly think we create more momentum with new products in general than in the industry cycle. So a new product cycle is very good for us. And I think that in this case, there are two things. One, there is a large-scale adoption of, in this case, our Gen 4. But not just that. We brought out the Gen 5, but also in metrology we had products that were meeting a need. So I'd say that our market share position continues to be very strong. We are investing very heavily in new capability to bring it on. But the other thing we've done in response to the demand in China, we've actually restarted some of our product lines that are well-suited for that market because we believe market share in China is critical going forward. The other thing that's going on there and you may be well familiar is one of the big challenges a lot of our customers have there is talent and engineering talent. So one of the other ways we can help is with the worldwide apps, presence and the ability to support them as they ramp, not only do they benefit but we benefit from strong share as well.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Sure. Yeah. I think the way I think about it is the wafer inspection is really driving more capability in terms of – if you think about smaller defects and the actual scaling has happened to go into 7-nanometer, so not only do they need more capable tools but they have to run them at higher resolutions, which drives the utilization in a way that they need more capacity. Metrology, there are more layers, especially with multi-patterning. So what you end up with is more capacity device in addition to increased technology. So on a percentage base, both are growing slightly different drivers between the two though.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Yeah. Gen 5 is pretty much doing what we thought it would do. And like any new product introduction, not necessarily exactly in the places because it's kind of had different adoption in different locations. But we've broadened our penetration. And Gen 5 is now at both memory and at foundry and logic facilities. And we're seeing we've got multiple orders now in both foundry but also what we're seeing in memory. So we feel pretty good about our penetration. We're on the plan that we laid out when we introduced the product in terms of our 2016 objectives. And Bren can talk to the details of that. And then we hope to be entering – through 2017 entering 2018 with a lot of momentum.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Well, unpatterned really does benefit from 3D NAND. So we definitely see demand coming from 3D NAND. And we also see it just in general multi-patterning there are more layers and customers have long realized that monitor wafers can be a very efficient way to clean and maintain and come up from downtime on tools to re-verify their process. So that's really it. Plus we saw, as Bren said, we think the momentum continues based on some of the work we're seeing in the wafer manufacturers which are part of what was driving our March results. So we think that continues to be strong for us.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: It's a great question. Let's start with there's certainly a significant commitment, and I've been in this industry a long time and I would say I've heard this before out of China but we're seeing a lot more evidence now of actual commitment. There's also leadership has been put in place from other areas so you have experienced leaders now running a lot of these companies that have demonstrated their ability to run successful organizations in other parts of the world. So I think you have that. The biggest gap probably ends up being the engineering workforce to be able to execute. And I think in that case, what we're seeing is a lot of these ambitious projects are also coming with requests for support from equipment companies. And so we're definitely feeling that and are participating. We are relatively cautious too. And if you take our plans, we don't bake in everything that we hear that's said in China in terms of how we run the business. But we're also positioned to be able to support it, should it ramp. And I think the most significant part of that expansion to WFE is not in 2017 or 2018. It's actually toward the end of 2018-2019. And so I think it's still early. Right now we feel very good about the prospects for 2017, and the early 2018 numbers look very doable from our standpoint.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Not really. I mean, I think that goes to two things. One is our customers have always sought the lowest cost solution for solving the inspection problems. So if we had not expanded the Gen 4, then maybe that would be the case. But the Gen 5 in its development isn't yet at a point where it could have offloaded those inspections. Whenever we introduce a whole new technology platform, we almost are forced to reduce the functionality of it on introduction, which is the case here. So it has capability but it doesn't have the same breadth of capability that a Gen 4 would have. That will happen over time, and as that does, the Gen 5 will take more and more of the layers as we go forward.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA: Well, we definitely have a close partnership with many players across the board on, say, 28-nanometer, and I do think we support them as best we can. We don't really make money on services from that. What we do is we support them with tool sales. Our market share tends to be pretty good, and we're committed to doing what – helping them with best practices in terms of ramping their facilities. These are very capable people, but they do often appreciate the support. The other thing I'd mention is in some cases we've actually restarted some of the older products to be able to support them with exactly the capabilities that they need. So we're not selling the latest generation, in general, into those facilities. We'll sell a mix. Some new and some of the maybe Gen 3 kind of product line.
