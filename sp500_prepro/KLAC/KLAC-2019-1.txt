Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Chantal. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We are here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven’t seen the release, you can find it in our website. Today’s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today’s earnings press release and in the Investor Presentation on KLA-Tencor’s Investor Relations website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor’s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are subject to those risks and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rick.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we’d like to open the call up to your questions. We once again request you limit yourself to one question and one follow up, given the limited time we have for today’s call. Please feel free to requeue and we will do our best to give everyone a chance to rejoin today’s call as time permits. All right, Chantal, we are ready for the first question.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Chantal. No further commentary from us today. Thank you all for joining. This concludes our conference call.
Rick Wallace: Hey, Tim. This is Rick and then Bren will follow. It does not change our view for the rest of 19 -- ‘18 or what we are looking at a ‘19 based on the expectation we had from that customer. To your point, it was a strategical export control, obviously, other things would change if that were broadened, but as it stands today it does not change our view.
Rick Wallace: It’s the intensity has stepped up but it’s more consistent with what we have seen over the last year. Remember we have other products that contribute to that too such as the bare wafer inspection products, which are leveraged to the memory overall wafer shipment. So those products have been extremely strong as the wafer demand around the world continues to get stretched and because of flatness requirements, we have seen an uptick in our business for flatness measurement. So I think it’s more related to those functions and that really has been playing out throughout this memory cycle where intensity has grown partly because of the strength of the wafer houses themselves.
Rick Wallace: Yeah. Krish, let me take the first part, and then, let Bren answer. We are not concerned about this particular movement in the market. So this one was a very strategic export control that that let’s just be clear on that.
Rick Wallace: Hi, Harlan. It’s Rick. I will take the first part and then Bren will follow up. Let me start with -- we don’t break out our business by EUV in particular, but to your point there are a lot of drivers about EUV that are frankly good for KLA-Tencor and for helping our customers solve the related problems that they have with it. And as you mentioned, we are seeing good business and as we mentioned in the prepared remarks in our mask business due to the number of advanced starts that are going through fabs and there’s also support for print check as you mentioned with Gen 5 and also the overlay challenges that our customers face. So, it is a catalyst and a driver for us as we go forward, but we don’t break it out in particular and we are a little bit agnostic into how many tools there are per se next year. So our demand won’t really change if it’s the 30 tools they talked about or 20 tools. It’s really the driving of the new capability nodes that are driving our business. And, Bren, you can break up the second part.
Rick Wallace: And in terms of momentum, it’s playing out very much the same as prior generations when we got the new generations of inspection products or you have a couple of early adopters maybe one big early adopter that will drive it. Then you have customers that are maybe more evaluative of it and they will spend a lot of time trying to figure it out and then the momentum gets going when the customers who have not adopted realize the advantage that the leaders are having and then we see it kind of flow out. So when we model those, it’s not just the number of systems, it’s where they are located and the use cases. So we have -- some that are being utilized in the early stages of manufacturing support where others are in development. So we like the momentum of the product, we are finding unique capabilities. It is true that EUV creates more opportunities for that product to differentiate and for customers to rely on it. So we are feeling very good about how we are positioned as we go forward in 2019.
Rick Wallace: We have not -- we have had dialog and discussions and we are proceeding along the path that we had modeled where we were in terms of regulatory in China. We feel very good about the exchange that we are having and we believe we are on track to close that out this calendar year, so as we have said at this quarter. So we feel good about that we have seen no indication of any change in their posture based on any of the other things that are going on relative to trade.
Rick Wallace: Well, I mean, I think, it will be a continuation of the expansion we have seen in terms of the newer products that we have are going to be targeted at 5-nanometer. We see the process control intensity challenges are very significant for our customers because that that’s the node in which EUV is going to be adopted in a greater percentage. Some people are looking at some level of EUV at 7, but 5 is really where it increases an adoption then will drive a lot of use. So we are well positioned for now. We are working closely with the customers that are pushing their technology and this is part of the Gen 5 discussion that we have had in the past where a Gen 5 is really more of a development tool, if you go back a year ago and now it’s becoming more of a pilot tool an early production in 5-nanometer becomes more biased toward production. So we feel great about where we are with that tool but also the supporting metrology tools as well.
Rick Wallace: We are certainly in a period where there’s both there’s kind of three things working at once in favor of this business, which is there’s capacity expansion, there’s technological challenges associated with these activity and there’s increased flatness requirements. So it is true that that has stepped up the level of business. So we are modeling as we go forward is, we don’t see that level of growth going forward again where we have essentially over the last few years that business has grown quite a bit. But the sustainability of the current levels is what we are modeling in terms of when we talk with our customers as they continue to bring on capability. And remember, the percent of their wafers that are going to leading-edge right now is relatively small and so over time they have to convert more of that to leading edge and so we will be feathering in our products and support of that. So we feel pretty good about the current level of business that we have in the bare wafer and its sustainability. We don’t see another leg up though as we saw in the last few years as we went to this node.
Rick Wallace: Yeah. And we don’t just agree with the industry perspective that DRAM Investment in ‘19 will be coming down, we did see foundry up and so. But as Bren said it’s -- that’s not as much of the driver for us as the other factors he mentioned.
Rick Wallace: They have a -- there’s another process challenges I think that they are facing even though they have as you say that there -- they have the options that some of the bigger players might have tried to leverage. But it’s harder when you are relatively new and your scale isn’t as big to be able to do the reuse and some of the things that you have seen in the other places. So they are also tackling a number of technology challenges at once. We have excellent relationships there and we feel very good about the sustainability of that business. On a relative basis too, when you look at those fabs in terms of the scale they are significantly smaller, as I said, than what you’d see elsewhere. So, I think, it continues to be strong, I do think there’s even potential for more in the way of things like mash ups, where you will continuously strength. Ultimately they’d like to have wafer manufacturing, but I think that’s several years away before that would be a significant piece of that.
Rick Wallace: Well, I think, that the, you are going to start seeing some adoption of it very much depends on the economics, I think, and that’s going to be the big challenge. But I think we are going to see some in 2019 beyond what we have seen in pilot in 2018. It’s really a similar story that to what we see in logic, where EUV presents opportunities both in terms of the mask shop, obviously, with DRAM, you don’t have the number of starts, but you do have very significant concerns about lifetime and contamination and EUV cleanliness overall. But I think it’s much more about the scalability and scaling of the design role in DRAM and also some of the challenges they are trying to get around in terms of overlay control. So it’s a driver, but not as much as it is, of course, than logic.
Rick Wallace: Boy that’s -- it’s hard to speculate on that. But I would think there’s clearly a case that China is investing for strategic reasons, and therefore, it’s more additive in some ways than if they were to not be allowed to invest. So, I think, you’d probably see some impact. We rate that probability as low and maybe also because of the action that was taken was very targeted and for specific reasons. So we are not modeling that as one of the outcomes. But, yes, I think, that that would have an overall impact on WFE for sure.
Rick Wallace: Yeah. No. That’s a good way to think about it, because you are going to have to work through the deferred revenue associated with all the tools that were under warranty at the time of conversion. So there are some tools that are shipped right at the end of that quarter. So it will take a year for that to completely roll-off, although, it’s likely a little bit heavier in the front end than it is in the back half of the fiscal year. That’s a good way to think about it.
Rick Wallace: It looks pretty stable to us as we look at next year around as its more trailing edge that more of a foundry statement than an overall. But given the diversity of end markets around semis, if you look at those customers that are investing in the activity we are seeing. I’d see it being fairly stable. We will have to watch those markets and see. But at least at this point, that’s how it looks to us.
Bren Higgins: Yeah. Tim, I think, as we look at this year, we feel pretty good about the tools that we have shipped there and closing on that business. There’s some de minimis levels of business in our ship plans over the next several quarters and into our forecast for next year for that side. But I don’t think it changes in a material way anyway of how we are really thinking about the business going forward.
Bren Higgins: No. Tim, that’s a result of our adoption of 606 and what is happening there and I provided some color in the last call on this topic for -- to provide a little bit of clarity and there will be more in the -- in our SEC disclosures that we will file in the next couple of days. But what we are doing here is that given the experience of our customers around our obligations in the first year warranty, is very similar to second year and third year contracts, as we are having to carve out of the tool purchase and defer the revenue associated with that first year obligation. Historically, with the cost accrual, so what happened is, we have reversed the cost accrual and then for the tools under warranty, we have added the deferred revenue, which we will take over the next 12 months effectively for all tools that were under warranty effective the transition date to 606 on June 30th. So it’s a unique dynamic that you saw with a pretty big inflection. I think the dynamics around our service business are consistent Rick talked about in terms of our views of growth rate going forward. But you will see this, this step up that will happen here and we will see it probably play out over the next couple of quarters and then it will level back out something consistent with what we saw historically. So, no changes in cash flow or business operations, but given the experience is fundamentally consistent with second year and third year contracts, the literature guides us this direction in terms of how we treat those obligations.
Bren Higgins: Hey. John, it’s Bren. So those were shipments’ statements, not revenue and I think it’s an important distinction here, because as we go through this transition, one anchor of continuity is the shipment metric, which is why we are continuing to provide not only actual results and context, but also guidance. So to be consistent with what we had said previously and to be consistent with this metric that is unchanging, our commentary reflects that. So as we move into this first half, I think, that the way the second half of this year has played out is very similar to the way we described in an update that we did back in September, where the September quarter came in a little bit stronger, December quarter sequential growth weaker and consistent with that guidance. So as we look at the first half of next year, we see an increase in the foundry and logic investment and we see memory in a relatively balanced profile as we move into the first half of the year. I would say that it is modest growth in terms of our expectations and we look at the build plan. But -- and I am not going to comment at this point of whether given where we are whether it’s March or June, but as we look at the first half given the timing and our conversations with customers, that’s how we are seeing the first half play out at least at this point in terms of shipments.
Bren Higgins: Yeah. Krish, so shipments, 27% of shipments in the September quarter were China and that, I would say that most of that is indigenous China. There wasn’t a lot of activity with the multinationals there, probably, a little bit, but not a lot. And consistently, as we have looked at that indigenous business into this year and into next year, the range you talked about is about how we are seen it in terms of shipment at revenue levels $500 million to $600 million is more foundry centric, a little bit more foundry centric and material centric in 2018, it looks to be that way in 2019 as well, at least from an order perspective, but generally, we expect a continuation of momentum from those customers. And to the earlier point, I think, we feel, okay, I mean, strategically that this situation around export control tend to be confined to that one particular situation, and as we said earlier, we don’t think it has much effect on how we are running the business or planning for it into next year.
Bren Higgins: So, I will make a couple of comments around ‘19 and the first is, we do expect foundry/logic to be up in ‘19 versus ‘18 and that we expect the first half to be modestly up from a shipment perspective versus ‘18 -- the second half of ‘18. So we will have more to say as we get to the end of this quarter and report results for the December quarter on the total year view. But at least that’s how we see it right now. You are right. Those segments are good segments for KLA in terms of process control intensity. Our margins are very consistent across our customer base. I don’t think it affects the margin profile or expectations from that business. But, certainly, that business were more exposed to in terms of the process control intensity of those wafer fab dollars. So we are encouraged by that. We will see how the broader industry plays out and have more to say about that as we move into December and in the first part of next year.
Bren Higgins: So on gross margins, Harlan, I think, as we look at next year this and in my comments in the script, we see things operating generally around this level, product mix will drive us directionally here and there from quarter-to-quarter. But in and around this 64%-ish plus or minus 50 basis points looks like that’s how things are trending right now. Obviously, if we see expansion in the business, we should get leverage and that would work probably both directions if it turns out that the revenue were to come down. So, but in terms of the fundamental structural dynamics around margins that’s generally the right place to be.
Bren Higgins: Yes. Harlan, we did hit our target. So we are consistent with the numbers that we provided earlier and we would expect an increase into next year. I would expect revenue from Gen 5 into next year given the drivers that you mentioned that Rick elaborated on, we would expect an increase in Gen 5 revenue in ‘19 versus what we saw in ‘18.
Bren Higgins: So my statement was around shipments, and not about orders, and I think, right now that the plans our customers have put in front of us given what we are seeing is it doesn’t seem to necessarily be pricing dependent, obviously, that does influence how they think about overall supply. But we have seen a number of adjustments already and how those have played out through ‘18 and those pushes into ‘19. So based on what we know today, our expectation is to see some balanced investment into the first half of ‘19 from a shipment perspective, and as I said, modestly up versus the second half of ‘18.
Bren Higgins: You are right. It’s a good question and they are higher. We have seen some increases related to some of our long lead time products that are in the queue, namely the reticle inspection products and we talked about some of the incremental demand that we are seeing for that tool and those are long lead times so we have to get in the queue to buy that those materials early. We have a number of new products that are coming out and so we are spinning up supply chain to support that in some cases you work -- we are working with newer suppliers and so, we are buying early to qualify parts to support a ramp. We have a new product launch in laser scanning, in E-beam. We talked about Gen 5 and the increments for Gen 5 into next year. So, all those things are driving the inventory levels higher. As we move over then that I would expect based on what we are seeing in terms of output expectations into next year that we will see that number flatten out and that will be -- that’s a -- as we start to put that material into tools and ship those tools out. So we are committing earlier and in those cases to make sure we have got the products in position so we can ramp them and that’s where we see in our financials is in the inventory build.
Bren Higgins: Yeah. CJ, maybe this is something we need to reconcile with you, but deferred revenue, revenue backlog should come down. One thing about the 606 is, given the timing issues and given our implementation of 605, which was rules based and as a result took us longer to meet the conditions of transfer and customer acceptance, under 606 we get there much faster. So from the time we ship a tool till the time we revenue, it should only be about a month. So we should see deferred revenue related to that to come down. I talked a little bit about the warranty dynamic earlier, which will play out over the next few quarters. But there isn’t anything in particular that’s -- that special or unique about certain products is more really based on, if you ship a new product and it’s first of a kind of matching requirement things like that, that we have to go all the way to an acceptance on. But under 606 you go to that acceptance level and in a much faster way, and then all the follow-on tools are generally, you see revenue at shipment. As you know the installation acceptance process becomes or is considered more perfunctory from an accounting perspective. So that’s what’s happening and I would expect the deferred revenues to come down over time given those dynamics.
Bren Higgins: In the first part of next year we will see the 7-nanometer tapeouts that are currently -- customers currently talking about we will see that drive up some activity, we are seeing in the mask shop, we will see it in the wafer fab as well and we will start to see more the n5 investments in early development as we move towards the second half of the year. As Rick said, it’s a challenging node, it’s a bigger node for EUV and we have got a number of products that are targeted for it. And I think, it will be interesting and intriguing business for us as we move into the second half of the year.
Bren Higgins: So that’s the statement on our expectations for shipments into the first half. That it’s a relatively balanced shipment profile across the two segments. So I don’t really have much more to say than that. I think we feel pretty good. We have to remember one thing about KLA is that we tend to be more about enabling technology and less about just raw capacity expansion and so as long as our customers are continuing to push their roadmaps and they are in DRAM and they are pursuing you know incremental layers in NAND that we see and expect to see a continued level of business from those customers irrespective of the capacity adjustments that could happen.
Bren Higgins: Well, they also are challenged to get used equipment, it’s a pretty tight market out there and we will sell at time you scale the equipment, we don’t really have in any of that in inventory. So what we have done is we have restarted older product lines to support some of that business or you are seeing current revenues or products that are de-configured to meet these trailing edge needs that certainly have the utility to be upgraded over time from those customers. So they are investing that way, and to Rick’s point, I mean, there are markets to ship into and eventually they will be able to get to a place where they can do that.
Bren Higgins: Part of what drives those, we have created options for those customers to upgrade their capability and so part of the business that we have for them even in a market where maybe they are not investing in new capacity is to upgrade their existing so they can get more efficient and we are seeing big demand for that and that was the initiative started a couple of years ago to be able to extend the value of the tools that are already in the installed base where we obviously have a home court advantage too.
