Theodore Lockwood: Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2017. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com. A simulcast of this call will be available on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented in a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the Investor presentation on our website. There, you'll also find the calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2017. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Theodore Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. All right. Christine, we're ready for the first question.
Theodore Lockwood: All right. Thank you, Christine. Thank you, all, for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Have a wonderful rest of the day.
Bren Higgins: Yes, Farhan. So I think since last -- it's Bren. So since the last call, certainly our expectations for next year has strengthened over the last 3 months, and we're seeing that in our outward forecast, which I provided some details to you in this call. I think when we look at the data, I think with the investments that are happening in 3D NAND, I think we still continue to expect that to be very strong. DRAM also looks like it's probably stronger now than what we thought a few months ago, and I think foundry/logic is flattish. I think logic will be slightly higher. But overall, I think the foundry/logic segment will be largely flattish and probably more second half weighted as we see it flow through our shipment profile over the course of the year.
Bren Higgins: Hey, Harlan, it's Bren. One other point I'll make, and I said this is in prepared remarks, but one of the uplift that we're seeing, the onetime uplift we're seeing to our operating expenses here in the December quarter, is driven by some prototype investment that we're expensing for this program. So Rick's characterization of timing seems to make sense and program's progressing according to plan.
Bren Higgins: So Harlan, on your first part of your question, so for the new memory projects and there's about 3 significant ones that we're tracking, we booked some orders back in the June quarter for a DRAM project that we will start to ship at the end of this quarter, right at the tail end of this quarter for installation into next quarter. The -- we also booked in this quarter significant orders for a 3D NAND project, and so we'll see those orders probably ship out towards the June quarter time frame. So to answer your question, we will see that business start to come to the P&L next year.  This year was more memory weighted as I described and probably a little over double in terms of the bookings from -- in China versus last year. And as we look at 2018, the order profile looks like it's flat to up from there. So a significant amount of activity there. Obviously, based on success with these Phase 1 investments, we play a pretty significant role early on as they're ramping the fabs. And so process control intensity is higher. Share tends to be better also because of the -- just the experience we can bring to help these customers navigate their yield and ramp these fabs quickly. And obviously, in memory, being able to progress the technology road map matters a lot to the economics of these projects.
Bren Higgins: Yes, on the last part first, C.J., I think that as we look at next year and look at the expected mix of business, we're likely going to see sustaining tailwinds that we've experienced in gross margin and we'll see that continue into next year. So as I'm modeling next year, I'm modeling it between 63% to may be as high as 64% over the course of the year. So pretty -- I think it continues, and what's driving it is a lot of the same factors. I mean, clearly, the product positioning and the differentiation and value we're adding to customers is playing out in the product pricing. I think the introduction of new products over the last 12 months or so -- the engineering execution has been great, so we've been able to climb up the cost curve pretty quickly on warranty and installation and some of those kind of things. We've been able to get a fair amount of leverage out of our service business as we've added tools into Korea and Taiwan. We can leverage the resources pretty well. So all in all, I think there's a number of factors, and I think that they're fairly sustaining as we progress into next year.
Bren Higgins: Well, I think Rick talked about from a memory perspective and what we're seeing in China. I think for the established customers, I mean, to that point, I mean, there is a participation -- a higher level of participation as they outfit a new fab on the front end. And then over time, the customer will probably scale back as they ramp that fab, as we generally see across a fab ramp. China is unique. Rick talked about that. And on foundry/logic, I don't think that there's anything different. I think it sort of follows the same model. There's a fair amount of development activity that happens upfront, and we participate above what the normal ramp level or the normal intensity levels are. And then over time as customers move from defect discovery to line monitoring, they tend to try to optimize a little bit more for fab productivity.
Bren Higgins: Well, so the statements were about the shipment profile. And as we look at this point and we look at the shipment profile into the second half of the year, it looks like based on the backlog we're bringing into the year and our expectations for orders in the first half gives us pretty good views into shipments into the second half. So we feel, at least at this point, it looks reasonably balanced across the year. And we're in this range of about $1 billion of shipments plus or minus $50 million as we look at our plan over the next several quarters. So it's still a ways out, and things can change. But based on how customers are slotting and how we're planning our manufacturing operations, that's how it looks.
Bren Higgins: Well, service looks like in calendar '17 will grow about 10%. Now its historical growth rate has been about 8%, if you go back to, let's say, 2000 or so and play that through. Now it grows every year, as it should, as the installed base is growing. So we are seeing an acceleration in service, and we were open with this in our last discussion of just our modeling for the business over the long run that we think service can maintain its historical growth rate. So we think service runs probably 7% to 9% over time. And part of what's driving it obviously is the growth of the installed base, but also the mature and legacy fabs and how they're running those fabs now to meet IoT and automotive demand and so on. So we're adding new capacity to some of those tools. They're running the tools harder, so they're running them longer, and so the contract and billable streams are nice. And one thing about our service business is it's about 70% to 75% service contract. So it's a very predictable stream that we can build our cost structure around and move forward with.
Bren Higgins: Yes, so on process control intensity for in and around memory, I think at planar NAND versus 3D NAND and DRAM, DRAM was always around 9%. Planar NAND was probably 8% or so. And if we look at across total memory today, we're in that 9% to 10% range. Clearly, as we've been talking about for several months, we think there are some opportunities not only for more inspection in terms of various defectivity in 3D NAND, but also opportunities in and around metrology as metrology's much more intensive for 3D structures than planar structures. One thing that's also been driving our business is the increasing specs around flatness and wafer flatness for 3D NAND. And so we've seen our wafer customers investing more new capability to be able to produce wafers for the IC customers to be able to meet that spec challenge. That doesn't show up necessarily in some of our pure IC numbers from memory, but it's certainly a derivative effect that's positive. So we think we make some progress on these 2 offerings that we think that, that can probably drive to an opportunity that can be $200 million to $300 million across both platforms. I don't think you'll see that in '18. There's an adoption time line that's associated with that. But over time, it could be -- if we can solve the problem, I think there's an opportunity that's in that magnitude.
Bren Higgins: Yes, Jagadish, this is Bren. So that was reticle inspection. And so we had a couple of tools that we booked in the quarter focused for -- on EUV development activities from captive mask shops.
Bren Higgins: If I look at the mix -- yes, just one other comment. If I look at the mix for calendar '18, it looks like it's slightly more foundry weighted than memory. Calendar '17 was more memory weighted; '16 was foundry. So I would expect more foundry investment in '18 from that region, and that's the native China business.
Bren Higgins: Yes, Farhan, it's a good question. I mean, clearly, we raised the dividend back in June, and we raised it almost 10%. Our model -- and the business has strengthened and the performance has been very strong. So clearly, we've outpaced that target. I mean, that's -- when we talk about that target being in that sort of 40% to 50% range, that's a 3-cycle target over time. We think about it that way because you're going to have periods you maybe under it when business is strong, but business [indiscernible] obviously want to build it to be able to not only just maintain it, but also raise it in weaker times. So over time, we target the growth rate of the total dividend payout versus the growth rate in earnings. And so if you look at our model right now where we see the top line growing 6% to 8%, we think we can grow the bottom line greater than 10% on that, that we'd grow the dividend payout in that greater than 10% range. So there's a couple different ways you can look at it. I mean, clearly, as the business continue to grow and we've raised it now with 6 or 7 years in a row. So this is a very consistent process on an annual basis, and we'll run through that process again as we complete our strategic planning process for the year.
Bren Higgins: Well, so we started buying back some modest levels of stock a couple quarters ago. And you're right on all accounts, right? As we get through next quarter, we retire this note next month. We will be consistent with the commitments that we made back when we restructured the capital structure of the company back in 2014. So given the strength of the business, we're below our leverage levels. And so there is -- it's not necessarily a compelling reason for us to continue to delever. And we would redirect, I believe, in the shorter term towards share repurchase. Now there is the U.S. and offshore cash dynamic in terms of cash flow. And given the strength of some of our product lines, I think that our U.S. cash flow into next year is probably at the lower end of the 60% to 70% target range that we've referenced in the past.  But you're right, there will be some cash flow that will become available, and we'll run through our process. And first and foremost, we invest in our business, and we're doing that. And then secondly, as part of our -- capital structure is part of the company strategy. And so as we look at growth opportunities juxtaposed against shareholder return alternatives, it's part of our DNA and will be something that we will do. So I'll announce something when we have something.
Richard Wallace: Yes. Okay. Well, let's start with development and then think about HVM. For development, there's a lot of work. In fact, a fair amount of capacity of the Gen 5 systems are being used for print check and development. So I'd say that I don't think it consumes a tool right now, but it consumes part of the use case of a tool for us. When we get into HVM, it gets a little different. It depends on how big we think the adoption of EUV is and when. But we would expect that, that market grows because of just essentially the available technology for inspecting reticles. And so that will drive the print check market higher because there won't be an actinic tool for in-fab reticle for the first wave of tools. So I think you'd see it grow in size from them. We haven't sized it exactly, but I think for every company that adopts EUV in production, as the EUV scales, the applications for print check will grow commensurate. So maybe it gets to a couple tools per customer that are driving that.
Richard Wallace: Sure, Harlan. So the strategy for reticle inspection, as you mentioned, Teron right now is serving the need. And I think for customers, as they implement 7, whatever degree, 7 is going to be implemented, Teron with the combination with the Gen 5 for print check is the most economical and efficient solution for our customers. But you're right to point out that a 5-nanometer, our view was we will need more sensitivity on the reticle. Rather than design an inspection tool -- an e-beam inspection tool and modify a wafer tool and make it for reticle, we decided a couple years ago, several years ago, to target specifically the reticle market with a platform optimized for reticle inspection and being developed by a fair number of players from our platform that develop reticle tools for us. So we think we have a lot of expertise. We feel very good about that progress of that, and we are targeting introduction of that tool in the 2019 time frame to intercept 5-nanometer.
Richard Wallace: But just to add to that, I think -- remember the greenfield, in particular, these are not at-scale fabs. So we're at the front end where the intensity is higher as Bren was saying. I think the other advantage we will have in the memory market in China is some of the platforms that we've been developing for memory will come to maturity in time to support those, so we'll see process control intensity higher. But the investors in China and the fab managers are very focused on efficiency in all their investments, so we don't see them necessarily higher. It's more that the fabs are subscale and at the beginning of the ramp.
Richard Wallace: Well, we don't break it out, but it is significant. And it is often the case that when there are new specs is when -- and new products is when we see new adoption of technologies. So it isn't something we break out, but it is significant, especially for certain of our products. Bare wafer inspection we mentioned and also flatness we mentioned as being critical. And then of course, in the mask shops, it's the reticle tools both for overlay -- registration, but also for defect inspection. But pretty significant, but usually, the investment cycle on those is a little bit more in waves and less of an annual basis.
Richard Wallace: Sure. I think there are a couple of things to think about. The net of it all is we're not, at this point, capable of really seeing a big change in process control intensity, but it does move to different parts of our business. For example, right now we know there's even more pressure on wafer manufacturers for flatness for EUV. So there's an example where we'll get more. And what seems like perhaps unrelated, we also think that the Gen 5 application and adoption will be higher to support EUV print check but also initial production. There are fewer layers. So some of the films areas, we'll reduce -- the number of steps, we'll reduce, but there are new defect types. So right now when we model, we don't see a lot of difference in terms of overall capacity, and we have a number of flows that are what we believe the process flow would look like depending on the success of EUV. Where it will start to matter more and it's already impacting some is in reticle inspection, both with the Teron and then when we talk about later as we get to new capability 2019 for the gen -- or for the 5-nanometer and beyond, we'll see increase adoption as we go forward there.
Richard Wallace: Patrick, no. I don't think so. I think that the high-volume, if it's done in the current generation of EUV will be served by the Teron platform. I think when we get to the high NA production for EUV, which will come at the sub-5 probably in maybe 2022, 2023 time frame, that's when there'll be a need for the EUV reticle tool, but also potentially actinic tools at that time frame. But we don't see a need for them before that. We think we're fully covering the market in the next few years with the toolsets that we have.
Richard Wallace: Well, we've already seen some of that, right, with established players. And they do invest and you have to, again, look at scale because those fabs tend to be bigger than the giga fabs elsewhere in the world for those nodes. So process control intensity, by that definition, is higher. We do see increased interest in those nodes. And those new facilities, of course, when they're greenfield and they're coming up, they don't have the option of reusing any other equipment, so we do see opportunity there. So we think that there will be continued opportunity. And initially, we didn't see, I'd say a year ago, so we weren't envisioning the memory that we're seeing now in China, but we actually were anticipating logic. So it's something we've been prepared for and even have, in some cases, restarted old lines to support them with products that are more appropriate for those design rules.
Richard Wallace: And also, Farhan, as you can imagine, if there were a change in tax policy and we had access to more of that cash, we would revisit the payout ratio.
