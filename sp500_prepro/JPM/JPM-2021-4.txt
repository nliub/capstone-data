Jeremy Barnum: Right. Okay. So, three questions in there. Let me take them one at a time. So beta, at the end of the day, the reprice experience is going to be a function of the competitive environment. But for the purposes of working through the guidance, I can tell you that we’re assuming that this hiking cycle is going to be generally similar to the prior hiking cycle, all else equal. The environment is a little bit different in some important respects. So, I think the system this time around is flushed with deposits, is flushed with liquidity in a way that it wasn’t before. So, that could at the margin make the reprice a little bit slower. On the other hand, the competitive environment is different, especially with some of the neo bank entrants and that could go in the other direction. So, it will be what it will be. But for the purposes of the guidance, we’re assuming a reprice experience that’s similar to what we experienced in the prior cycle. In terms of deployment, obviously, deployment is going to be a situational decision. But, if you’re looking at the $4 billion bar on page 16, securities deployment is a modest contributor to that $4 billion number. The bulk of it is the loan growth narrative, particularly in card. And then, in terms of Markets NII, the whole point of not guiding explicitly to Markets NII is to avoid getting distracted by the noise there, which can come from a lot of really kind of relevant places, like interest rate hikes in Brazil and cash versus future positions, which is the example I’d like to give. But big picture, if you need something for your model or whatever, there’s a couple of things we could suggest. So, if you look at the supplement, we’ve actually been disclosing the Markets NII number for some time in the supplement. So, you actually have a pretty decent time series of that number over time. If you address that thing against the Fed funds rate, you’ll actually see that there’s a pretty clear negative correlation there. And so, you can draw some conclusions from that. But I just will point out that like in any given moment, relatively small changes to the mix of the Markets balance sheet can really change the NII quite significantly, even in an environment of no policy rate changes. So, it’s sort of like a health warning against putting too much emphasis on that projection.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes. So, let me do the second one first. So in short, yes. So, as I said in the script, we are not assuming any recalibration in that 17% target. So, that does mean 4.5% GSIB in the equity component of that number. In terms of SA-CCR, the impact of SA-CCR adoption was about $40 million of standardized RWA. So, I think if you do the math, that’s like 10 basis points of CET1.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes. So, as you know, John, in terms of share buybacks, that’s at the bottom of our capital stack. So, to the extent that we’re seeing robust loan growth, other opportunities to invest in the business as well as potential M&A opportunities, those are all going to come ahead of buybacks. And so, I don’t want to sort of guide on our buyback plans for next year, which under SCB, as you know, are really quite flexible as a function of the earnings generation outcomes, the capital build. But you can kind of draw your own conclusions in terms of the growth and the minimums that we see in the future as well as the loan growth as well as some of the investments that we’re making. And frankly, we’re kind of happy about that. That’s just -- we want the capital to be used that way rather than being used for buybacks.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes. So, in terms of the target, I mean, I said previously that 12% was not off the table. And that remains true. Depending on the outcome of the rule side, depending on the Basel III endgame, depending on all the various components, you can see a world where 12% remains the minimum. But as you can see, and as I said in response to Erika a second ago, the 17% target assumes something closer to 13% as a function of the expected increases in GSIB and some other factors. So, we’re kind of going to operate in that type of range throughout the year with obviously the flexibility that we have. And then, sorry, you also asked about normalization of markets and IB fees. I mean, I would say, if you’d ask me in the middle of the year, we were talking a little bit about thinking that a reversion to 2019 run rate was a thing that like could happen in theory. The way we feel right now, our central case is obviously that we will see some normalization from exceptionally strong performance, both in IB fees and in Markets. But I think we’re expecting that normalization to be a little bit less, like we’re near all the way down to the 2019 levels, partially because the banking pipeline is really very robust. We feel good about the kind of organic growth in equities and some of the share gains there. And then in fixed income, we’ve already seen a decent amount of normalization there actually. And as the monetary policy environment evolves next year, that could actually create some tailwinds for that business.
Jeremy Barnum: Right. Okay. I think I get your question, Glenn. So, number one, to the extent that we’ve done some M&A over the last 15 months, as you allude to, and that that has introduced some expenses into the run rate, the run rate impact of that is in the $3.5 billion. It’s a relatively modest contribution. On the top of my head, I want to say it’s probably like $300 million or something like that. So, it could be a little bit more, depending on some factors. So, that’s one point. The other point is that there are different types of investments here. So, if you look at, for example, the change in the marketing expense and the marketing investments that come through marketing expense in card, a lot of the decisioning of that actually happened as part of the reopening in the middle of the year. So, that’s actually already in the run rate. Whereas other aspects of the investment agenda are obviously thinks that we’re executing now, expanding in places, hiring people, hiring technologists to do things that we need to do. So hopefully that answers your question.
Jeremy Barnum: Your line is breaking up a tiny bit, but I think I basically hear your question, and I think the simple answer is yes. So, in other words, we’re sort of saying that as we -- as the environment continues to normalize in a variety of ways, so that includes policy rate normalization, rate curve formalization as well as run rate normalization and Markets revenues with the sort of some background expectation of growth in our Markets and Investment Banking revenues with the background expectation of growth, and when all of that plays out and is finished playing out, we believe we should be back to 17%, all else equal. So, you can kind of see -- it’s not that long, if you know what I mean, in terms of like what the current forwards imply about when you get back to a sort of more normalized policy rate environment.
Jeremy Barnum: Sure. Yes. So, in terms of C&I loan growth, as I said in the script, we are seeing an uptick in revolver utilization rates, especially in the commercial bank. And it remains sort of skewed to the smaller clients. But, we are starting to see an uptick in that actually even in the bigger clients. So, that gets an encouraging sign. One of the things I’ve heard from the folks who run those businesses is that one driver of that is CEOs and management teams who’ve been burned by low inventory levels as a result of the supply chain problems, wanting to run higher inventories, and that is maybe driving higher utilization there which, as a result, while it would, I guess, theoretically be a relatively permanent increase in utilization is not a thing that you can sort of project forward in terms of compounding the growth. But at the same time, we’re also hearing really quite a bit of confidence in the C-suites and all else equal, that should be positive for C&I loan growth. But clearly, the levels there are modest still in a world where capital markets have been exceptionally receptive to investment-grade issuance, in particular, and more recently, the high-yield issuance throughout the sort of pandemic period. And so, people are well funded from capital markets issuance.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So, there’s a lot of stuff in there. So, let me do mortgage and cards. So, in mortgage, you’ll see that if you sort of try to do a margin calculation by taking the production revenue and dividing it and so on, you do see an apparently significant drop in margin there. So, there’s a few drivers of that. One is the margins were actually slightly elevated in the prior quarter as a result of the timing of the flow-through of the loan-specific pricing adjustments. So, that’s one factor. In addition, you actually -- we did -- despite the fact that it was an exceptionally strong overall quarter of originations and for funded loans, as we started to see higher rates towards the end of the quarter, we did see the dynamic that you would expect in terms of drop in saleable new lock volume and so on. So, that’s a little of a factor. And then there’s the sort of the normal organic dynamics where you tend to see margin compression in mortgage with rates selling off a little bit. So, you have a bunch of factors driving a slightly lower number there, but the overall mortgage environment is quite healthy. And though obviously with higher rates we expect things to be weaker next year, we’re still predicting a $3 trillion mortgage market next year, which by historical standards is very robust. So, that’s that part. And then, in card, I imagine that you’re looking at the card income line where we had a significant drop last quarter. And this quarter, the number is also sort of relatively depressed relative to what we had two quarters ago when it was quite high. So you’ll remember that for card income, we had a sort of one-off item last quarter, depressing the number. This quarter, we have another sort of one-offish type item, which is the impact of the Southwest co-brand renegotiation, which is public. So, that’s contributing to the card income line, the revenue rate a little bit. But it’s important to note that in the background of all this is the impact of the customer acquisition amortization comfort revenue expense, which, as you know, amortizes over 12 months. And so, as I mentioned earlier, as part of the big sort of increase in customer engagement, as part of the reopening in the middle of the year, we ramped that up quite significantly, 100,000 point offers in the market and stuff like that. And so, that’s coming through the numbers. So, as a result, when you look at the sort of full year revenue rate for card of around 10%, we actually see that as a reasonable central case for next year with the sort of elevated marketing and customer acquisition amortization being offset, obviously, by expected growth in NII with the revolve narrative that we’ve laid out.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So, I mean, at some level, the question that you’re asking is this perennial question of how can we be sure that the investments that we’re making are paying back and on what time line and how do we measure that? And it’s interesting. We were just talking about card marketing. I think of that as a continuum. You have a continuum of investments that start with card marketing where every dollar that we put into card marketing investment as part of a very sophisticated, extremely data-driven, highly measurable set of decisioning to ensure that all of those are accretive and when we have sort of measurable outcomes in the short term. So, there’s a lot of signs there, and it’s pretty precise and you get feedback pretty quickly. At the other end of the continuum is tech modernization type stuff, which is a big part of the theme right now. And those things are things that are just we obviously need to do them. If we don’t do them, we’ll be clunky and inefficient and hamstrung in the future when we’re trying to compete. And it’s impossible to prove in some narrow financial sense that there is a tangible return payback from that, but we know that they’re absolutely mandatory. So, when we think a little bit about the revenue outlook in our kind of normalized run rate, we are certainly assuming that many of the investments that we’re making now and that we’ve made over the last couple of years will produce the revenues that we expect in that time horizon. But, a lot of what we’re doing is not of that nature. And in some sense, those are actually the most important investments because they’re the hardest decisions to make.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes. So, if you look at the bottom left-hand side of page 16, footnote 3, an extremely small print, you will note that the implied curve that we use is from January 5th. So, you can take that curve and whatever the current curve is and use the table on the bottom right and add a long list of caveat that I won’t give you and draw your own conclusions. But I mean, it should be a modest increase, modest additional tailwind, very modest. While we wait for the next question, I said something inaccurate before. I realized I wasn’t that confident when I said that. The $40 billion standardized RWA increase in SA-CCR, if you do the math, is obviously not 10 basis points of CET1. It’s 30 basis points of CET1. So, correction coming through there.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So, I mean, I forget exactly what the market is assuming about the start of QT at this point, QT2 as they’re now calling it. But from us, I look closely, there was expected to be a pretty long lag between sort of the end of the hiking cycle and the beginning of QT2. Maybe people are now starting to accelerate that. But in any case, the important point is that as a result of the acceleration of tapering, the amount of balance sheet growth is ending pretty quickly. And therefore, the impact on system-wide deposit growth should be quite modest this year. And that -- and our assumptions are consistent with that. In other words, we’re not assuming lots of deposit growth next year because ultimately that’s going to be primarily a function of the Fed balance sheet size. But obviously, we are still assuming modest growth rather than reduction as a function of QT, if you know what I’m saying. And so, then, in terms of deployment, you can see in the supplement that we already did some deployment this quarter. It was primarily in the front of the curve. So, we’re still being quite cautious about really buying duration. And if you look at again page 16, you noticed that we call out securities deployment as a modest driver of that $4 billion increase that’s tied as balance sheet growth and mix. So, it’s reasonable to assume that we might be -- we might do a little bit of duration buying if the rate curve develops as the forwards predict, but it shouldn’t be too dramatic.
Jeremy Barnum: And Betsy, the only thing I want to add to that, which I was going to basically say the same thing, this whole like ask for 10 and hope to get 5. I mean, we would -- we aim to manage the Company much better than that. So, I certainly don’t have that type of authority. That’s not the way it works. And I think the important point is that what actually happens is a ton of scrutiny of the investment agenda, two or three levels down in the organization with a lot of discipline there. So that’s where the conversations happen about whether this makes sense to do now, whether it’s the right priority now, whether we have the capacity to do it, whether in the case of where the returns are measurable, where it’s producing the right returns. And that’s really part of how we operate the Company and part of the discipline of the day to day.
Jeremy Barnum: This is fine. It’s perfectly reasonable question. So, okay. So, here you go. So, when you look at the current state of the so-called Basel III endgame or Basel IV proposals, and you look at the RWA components of them in isolation, you’ve got the change in the credit conversion factors, which all else equal is a tailwind. You’ve got the fundamental review of the trading book, which is quite complicated and it’s going to depend institution by institution, but it’s potentially for some folks a headwind. And then, you’ve got the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized RWA. And if you look at sort of central case estimates of all those things in a simple way, you will conclude that there’s a bunch of RWA inflation. But, a couple of things. First, there’s all things plays in the context of the global regulatory community or at least in the U.S. saying that the system has enough capital. And it doesn’t actually need more capital. And it’s important to realize…
Jeremy Barnum: Yes. And so, it is important to realize, Steve, that as you know, obviously, there are additional tools. So the most important one of which is how standardized output floors interact with the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized RWA, and then in turn, how that interacts potentially with the Collins Floor as well as more generally the fact that there are opportunities to tweak, potential double counting and the stress capital buffer against FRTB and so on and so forth. So, the point of all this is that there are more levers and tools here than just the overall RWA inflation. And the way we see the world, we don’t expect the Basel III endgame in and of itself to increase the dollars of capital that we need to carry as a company.
Jeremy Barnum: Exactly. And we are allowing the G-SIFI increases to flow through to the medium-term ROTCE assumptions.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So, in terms of credit cost, as I said, we’re assuming a roughly normal credit environment at that point. So that would mean card charge-off rates back into the sort of low to mid-3s type of thing. As we said, pre-pandemic, we were assuming we would get to, especially as we underwrite some slightly higher loss vintages over time.
Jeremy Barnum: Importantly, Yes, exactly. So, I mean, I would just broadly describe, and consistently with the way we’re describing it, which is kind of medium-term guidance in a normalized environment that the charge-off environment should, in turn, be normal. So, that’s that. And then, you’re kind of asking me, I guess, about the overhead ratio a little bit. So personally, I kind of don’t love that measure. I think it’s more of an output than an input. And more often than not, it’s driven by revenues, not expenses. And more often than not, in the short term, the revenue number that’s swinging is a function of the rate curve. So essentially, the overhead ratio just becomes a proxy for the Fed funds rate, which makes it not a great management tool for the company. But having said that, in the assumptions that we’re using to build up that 17% rate, we do get back to something like a 55% overhead ratio. But, as Jamie said before, if that number has to go up to deliver the right returns in the long term, it will, like we don’t consider it to be a constraint.
Jeremy Barnum: In a world where there are inflationary pressures, there’s a lot of post-pandemic effects in the numbers, and we have some critical investments to make. The notion of operating leverage at the level of the Company’s overall numbers for me becomes just not terribly meaningful. I’m not criticizing your question. I understand what you’re asking, but is this kind of another way you think about it.
Jeremy Barnum: My version of that, which is consistent with Jamie’s is that we continue to be interested in looking at M&A, and we’re doing that. Obviously, yes, very large deals aren’t realistic. And the fintech investment part is definitely part of the stuff that we’re looking at when we look at deals.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean -- it’s funny. I wouldn’t actually describe retiring technical debt as playing defense. I mean, I think that’s actually a great example of the whole point of this conversation, which is that retiring technical debt is an easy thing to not do if you’re playing defense focused on short-term targets. But if you’re playing offense for the long term, it’s exactly this type of decision that creates some of the frustration that you’re articulating that’s critical for the long-term success of the country -- the Company. So that’s…
Jeremy Barnum: Yes, sure. So I think broadly for the company, there’s no really large change in our credit risk appetite, and therefore, in our underwriting standards. I think I alluded a little bit to this earlier, which is there’s a subtlety in the card business, where if you remember, pre-pandemic, we had talked about card charge-off rates being at 3.25% and maybe trending a little bit higher over time as a function of some underwriting of some slightly higher risk vintages, still well within our credit box, still within our overall credit risk appetite, but just a slight shift in the composition of the portfolio there. So, that happened back then, and we just didn’t see it flow through because of obviously the extraordinary dynamics that we’ve experienced with pandemic. And now, we’re exiting the fourth quarter of this year with a card net charge-off rate. And I forget the exact number, something like 1.2% or something, so.
Jeremy Barnum: Obviously exceptionally well. So, the question then becomes like -- and then I think somewhere in your question there was also about like when we sort of leaned into the reopening, how did we modify the credit box and standards. And the answer to that is that we returned it essentially to the pre-pandemic level. So we were obviously very confident in light of what we were seeing about what credit conditions were.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes. And so, Gerard, to your point about the fourth quarter of next year, right? I mean, one lens to look at that through is what do we think the trajectory of normalization of card net charge-offs is through the course of 2022. And I don’t want to get into too much specific guidance there, but the numbers that we’re putting on the page roughly assume that we get back to that kind of like low-3s around the end of 2022 or early ‘23 in terms of card net charge-offs. So yes, on the one hand, maybe we’ll be talking a lot about the fact that those numbers are going up, but they will have actually gone up exactly in line with our expectations.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes. So, on digital banking, we’re not going to disclose specific countries that we’re going into, one.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean I think just to validate Mike’s question, as you know, we have made this investment in C6 in Brazil. So Brazil, it’s not exactly the same. It’s not a de novo build by us, but we’re there. We’re engaged. It’s a significant investment. And Brazil is like a very interesting country from a consumer banking perspective and the digital play there is quite interesting. So, that’s one example. And obviously, we’re thinking about additional places to go, and we’ll let you know when we do it.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes. I mean, I don’t know. I’m personally not a big fan of these types of like anecdotal individual like tech stories. I mean, there’s cool stuff, like we’re doing some AI-enabled lead optimization stuff in AWM, for example. So I could come up with a list of like 20 things like that. But in reality, it’s really much more about the embedding of the modernization and the digitization of the whole ecosystem as part of customer engagement and competition and making the company more efficient and all that type of stuff. Examples where it’s like I spent $10 million on X that’s technology as opposed to like branch build or banker hiring, as Jamie says, and you can then attach a tangible revenue outcome to that. I’m sure we have some of those examples somewhere. I don’t have them with me. Maybe we can talk about them next quarter. But I generally think that that sort of gets into a lot of anecdotal stuff that distracts from the big picture.
Jeremy Barnum: Yes. So, a couple of things. If you go back to my prepared remarks, so it’s like $12-ish billion, a bit more, 50-50, run the bank, change the bank. And within the change agenda, half again is kind of modernization-type stuff as opposed to features and products. So, it gives you a little bit of a...
Jeremy Barnum: But Mike, just a big one example, I guess, from a business that I know you know well. If you look at Teresa’s Securities Services business, it’s an interesting example of the way the investment relates to the strategy. So, in that business, as you know, historically, winning new mandates, especially on services administration tended to involve significant correlated large increases in expense as you had to onboard a lot of fund accountants. And so, that was typically the dynamic there. And I think a lot of the investment that we’re making there is to make that business a little bit more scalable in that respect so that when we win new business, it’s a little bit more accretive. So, that’s kind of an interesting example of is that tech investment that produces more revenue? I mean, I guess. I would describe it as investment that means that when we win the revenue, it’s more profitable, for example. At the same time, we’re also building out some really great capabilities in there in terms of data and stuff like that, which maybe will help us win more mandates.
Jamie Dimon: Glenn, I would just like to add, we don’t really know about 2023, and I’d be very cautious in that. Plus, I expect more interest rates increases is in the implied curve. And obviously, the world is very competitive. I also want to point out that a 17% return on tangible equity, if you can get that to the rest of our lives would be exceptional. So, reconfirming that that’s kind of what we do, we can do is pretty good. By the way, I would say 15% on tangible for the rest of my life, if I can guarantee that.
Jamie Dimon: And some are very basic. Opening 400 branches, $800 million a year, obviously, the payback comes over time, adding thousand of sales people kind of know pretty much what the payback is, but obviously, it comes over time. And so it’s a whole mix. And just think about it as expenses you should expect to go up a little bit in 2023.
Jamie Dimon: I answer that question. We do not sit at the table and tell people you can only do X. We sit at a table and ask people what do you want to do? So, think of it’s 100% within our capability because some things you just simply can’t do. You can’t attack 14 funds at the same time or something like that. And that’s number one. So, we want to make those kind of investments. Each one goes through kind of rigorous process as is necessary. Some of them are table stakes. I do remember sitting around the table one day and people talking about digital account opening and do NPV. I was like just don’t do an NPV. Just get it done. That’s just serving your client properly and stuff like that. And so -- and like as I said, a lot -- I mean, Jeremy mentioned it’s 400 branch in the United States. It’s 13 sites overseas. It’s more countries, more products. It’s all the things we should be doing that you’d want to do if you owned 100% of the Company. So, it may not be what you do if you have to meet NII next quarter of X, Y or Z or something like that. And the second part of your question wasn’t that, it was -- the consumer digital and stuff like that. We’re not going to start giving you real numbers and all that, but that is a march. That’s a journey, and it’s hard. And we want to get there as soon as possible. Pieces and pockets have already gotten there. So certain applications and certain datasets already running on the private cloud, somewhere in the public cloud, some parts of the company ahead of other parts of the companies, that’s a lot of work. And there is -- you guys have pointed a little bit call it bubbles expression there. We’re not going to disclose that either because then we just got a doctor closing 84 other bubble expenses. Those are our responsibility. And to the extent we have opportunities to do more, we will do more. We have extraordinary capability. And I think I also want to point out, Jeremy, you mentioned the assumptions around capital. I mean, SLR, G-SIFI, and most of these other companies should be recalibrated, okay? Even the regular these things should be recalibrated for the global side, the global economy. If you put capital against treasuries and capital Fed deposits and let’s see what happens. So, we -- on that, we’re kind of conservative. We’re not going to be expecting a lot of relief. But, even some of the folks yesterday we mentioned that were being questioned Fed prospects were being questioned about SLR and acknowledge that there are issues around SLR that are not good for the markets.
Jamie Dimon: I’d like to give you another example. If we can spend $2 billion more and get to the cloud tomorrow, I would do that in a second.
Jamie Dimon: It’s possible. But if it happens, it will be for a good reason. And I read about the competition, the global competition, the nonbank competition, direct fiber lending competition, there’s Jane Street [ph] competition, the [indiscernible] competition, there’s fintech competition, there’s PayPal competition, there’s direct competition, it’s a lot of competition, and we intend to win. And sometimes you guys spend a few bucks.
Jamie Dimon: And I want to emphasize, too, embedded upon that, as we’ve always said, we’re going to -- we want to be very, very competitive and pay. There’s a $1 billion in merit increase. There’s a lot more compensation for our top bankers and traders and managers who actually say, by the way, did an extraordinary job in the last couple of years delivering this stuff. And we will be competitive and pay. And that squeezes margin a little bit for shareholders, so be it.
Jamie Dimon: We will very, very aggressively manage those things when we know the actual numbers, like very aggressively manage them.
Jamie Dimon: Well, first of all, we prepare for all eventualities here. We’re not kind of guessing at one. But the consumer is very strong. And with respect to the fact that people suffering still and COVID and all that, the fact is despite of Omicron, in spite of supply chains, 2021 was one of the best growth years ever. And 2022, it looks like it either be 3.5% or 4%, which is actually pretty good. The consumer is $2 trillion more in their balance sheet, their home prices are up, asset prices are up, jobs are plentiful, wages are going up, which is good for them. We’re not against that, and sharing the wealth a little bit of Americas recovery with everybody. So, the consumer is in really good shape. The spending, I mean, Jeremy took you through the numbers, 25% more than they spent in pre-COVID. 25% more. And that number drives all the order books for everybody else, whether it’s goods and services and obviously, it’s bouncing around between goods and service dollar, kind of stuff like that. Businesses equally are in very good shape with cash and capability and confidence levels are high. What are they seeing? They’re seeing their order books go up, more cars, more motors, more patios, more home improvements, more homes, more demand. We have a shortage of homes in America. So, you see the table is set pretty well with -- for the growth -- with obviously the negative being inflation and how that gets navigated and stuff like that. So, my view is a pretty good chance there’ll be more than 4. It could be 6 or 7. I mean, I grew up in a world where you -- Paul Volcker raised interest 200 basis points on a Saturday night. And this whole notion that somehow it’s going to be sweet and gentle and no one is ever going to be surprised. I think it’s a mistake. That does not mean we won’t have growth. It does not mean unemployment -- in a good position and stuff like that. And the other fact is, it may very well be possible that they’re loan rates -- and I’m a little surprised how low they stay. But the loan rates may react more to the actual QE and then QT. And so, at one point, the Fed is going to be letting run off $100 billion or whatever number a month they’re going to come up with. And then you may see loan rates react a little bit to that. And particularly, I just said about growth and demand for capital and stuff like that, that also tends to drive 10-year bond rates and all that. So, all things being equal. If you look at the company, and it’s very important, we have huge firepower to grow, to expand, to make loans to extend duration and you look at capital liquidity, I just want to point out, it’s $1.7 trillion -- these numbers I’ve never seen the bank with them. And you look at percentages, not just gross amounts, $1.7 trillion in cash and marketable securities, $1 trillion of loans, okay? There’s $500 billion or $600 billion of those cash and marketable securities that could be deployed in higher-yielding assets or loans when and if the time comes depending on all these capital constraints and stuff like that we have to deal with. And those are extraordinary numbers. It’s $2.5 trillion deposits. And we don’t like taking risky deposits. Those are -- they may go down a little bit in QT and all that. But look at how this balance sheet is funded. I’ve never seen a bank balance sheet like that. And that’s -- think of that as kind of firepower over time as we navigate through the world. And so, we’re in pretty good shape. And if -- I wish I could own 100% of the company and be private.
Jamie Dimon: Yes, I would expect that because almost every CEO is talking about wages and certain inflation and stuff like that. But I just -- I don’t want to be -- please don’t say I’m complaining about wages. I think wages going up is a good thing for the people who have the wages going up. And businesses simply have to deal with changes in prices. So, if you -- commodity prices go up and down, mozzarella goes up and down, wages go up and down. They shouldn’t be cried babies about. They just deal with it. The job is to serve your client as best you can with all the other factors out there. So I’m not opposed to it. But I do think you’ll see more people seeing wage pressure, et cetera, and some have more ability to offset it than others. It hasn’t stopped us from doing anything, zero, none, nada. We’re not cutting back in growth plans or bankers or markets or countries because there was some wage inflation.
Jamie Dimon: So, the large transactions like over billions unlikely. But we always look. We’re always open mind. We’re looking all over the place for things that fit in and stuff like that. And then the pace of fintech investors, stuff like that, that won’t change at all.
Jamie Dimon: Great. But it’s battle and gate. I mean, some of these people do a very good job. I think there are some things we, your bank should have done, so we should be a little self-critical. But we have the capability, the economies of scale and all these things. What we’re not going to do is hamstring ourselves to meet an overhead target. That’s just not even on the card. And we have assets and strengths. Look, the competition is very bright. I mean, they’re bobbing and weaving. They’re not changing, and they’re not static. And I think sometimes few act like they’re static and they’re not static. But if we do a good job, like today, on consumer, I’m sure some you Chase customers, free trading, a lot of ATMs, you’ve got better and better services, more navigation bars, more offers, more travel, more rewards, more -- and you got more of that coming. And we’ve gotten friendlier an overdraft. We’ve gotten -- that’s just one business. That’s true for every single business. So, I look at middle way around JPMorgan, that’s going be pretty tough competition. Like take Chase UK. We’ve been very, very clear that costs us money, and a lot of you want to pay back tomorrow and stuff like that, we’re not going to disclose those numbers, but we are there for the long run. We’re going to be adding products and services and countries for the rest of our lives, okay? So, I doubt, over the long run, we’ll fail. We may not do -- we may not become the best digital bank in the UK or somewhere in the short run.
Jamie Dimon: Michael, I feel your pain and frustration. It is very possible in 2023, we’ll have a 17% ROTCE. It depends on how we deploy our capital. It depends on fixed income markets. It depends on a bunch of stuff like that. But every -- but the 400 branches that we’re building, those things will get to contribution profitability just like we expect. The thousand bankers we’re adding in private banking, and Chase Wealth Management, we’re pretty sure we’ll get to breakeven but just we expect that takes a couple of years. And so yes, we can’t -- we’re not going to tell you all of those things. And we already mentioned some of the tech stuff is just kind of we have to do it, and there’s a little bit of bubble expense in that. There’s even a little bit of bubble expense on new headquarters. And so, we’re pretty comfortable we’re doing the right things. And we’re being a little conservative. Like Jeremy was talking about the card stuff, the return, I told our folks that we’re going to -- our card growth this year, but they were skeptical. The American consumer is very strong. Our products and services are very good. Chase, we call now self-directed investing has $55 billion. I think Robinhood has, I think, 80, the last time I saw, something like that. We’re not seeing your -- bragging about our product because I would say it’s not good enough yet. But it’s got $55 billion without us doing virtually anything and or no marketing and no real stuff like that. So, there’s a lot of stuff coming. The competition, we have to face. Some of these acquisitions we made will contribute to profit, maybe not exactly in 2022. But -- and I mentioned the deployment of the balance sheet. We’re pretty conservative in deploying the balance sheet. That may not always be true.
Jamie Dimon: So, we spent $2 billion on brand-new data centers, okay, which have all the cloud capability you can have in private data centers and stuff like that. We’re still running the old data centers. Now, we’re not going to get involved in every time you talk, I’ll explain every part of the pain cake buildup of expenses going in and expenses going out. But all this stuff going to these new data centers, which is now completely up and running are -- well, some are, but most of the applications that go in have to be cloud eligible. Most of the data that goes in has to be cloud eligible. We’re running a whole bunch of major programs, which I don’t think we disclosed on AWS. And we’re working with Google and Microsoft to run some of the stuff into cloud, so we want to have multiple cloud capabilities. And this year, roughly 30%, 40%, 50% of all our apps and all data will be moving to cloud-related type of stuff. This stuff is absolutely totally valuable. I mean, I can’t -- if you sat in this room and look at the power of the cloud and big data on risk, fraud, marketing, capabilities, offers, customer satisfaction, dealing with errors and complaints, prospecting, it’s extraordinary. You actually see some of that already in how we manage stuff. Like, for example, with all the fraud and all the cyber and all the ransomware, our fraud calls are down this year. There’s a reason for that. It’s because we’ve deployed huge capabilities in those things. So, we have to do those things. And that’s a margin that will be hugely valuable for us. And you’ll see some of that benefit, which is why we’re comfortable that we’ll continue to grow and expand and earn. Like I said, with 17% return on tangible capital, I would take that. If I could push a button and give you that the next 20 years, I would take it. And also, if I did it for the next 20 years, that number would probably be like a big part of the GDP of the United States of America.
Jamie Dimon: Mike asked another very good question market shares. We expect to go up in retail deposit market share, investment market share, private banking market share, fixed income market share, equity market share, investment banking market share, global market share, payments market share and security services market share, commercial banking market share, and what did I miss? I’d be surprised if any of them go down. And we’re not going to give you the number.
Jamie Dimon: None of that was completely material to the results. But one of the things in Jeremy’s slide that you point, we’ve been over earning on credit for years. And we expect that eventually to normalize. You could argue how fast and what time, but credit card has been a number that you’ve never seen in our lives. Middle market has been lower than ever. Other sales have been lower than ever. Mortgages have been lower than ever cards. They’re all low. Eventually, they’re going to normalize. And then we kind of build that out. And the other thing is the loan book, and this is very important for your own modeling. Just assume as the loan book grows, we will add reserves pretty much proportionate to the growth in the loan book, all things being equal. We’ve got CECL and all this stuff like that. So, there’s -- that’s a flip to the negative, obviously, for next year, one item.
Jamie Dimon: I think, we’re in a -- again, some of those things are outcomes of decisions you make based on client stuff. But the real fact is we got Basel IV, a lot of changes. And when all that happens, we’ll give you a little bit better update how we’re going to deploy capital and invest the balance sheet and stuff like that. But we’re in no rush to reinvest part of that balance sheet. We’ll be very patient.
Jamie Dimon: Hey, Mike. I’m going to give you one example, which may be a little helpful on this tech platform thing. I think, these numbers are accurate -- we did this a while ago. Card runs a mainframe -- which is quite good. We have one of the most efficient, most economic, 60 million accounts, et cetera, it’s been updated for years, but it’s a mainframe system in the old data center. When it gets modernized to the cloud, the cost savings by running that and marginalizing it will be $30 million or $40 million a year. That isn’t the reason we’re doing it. The reason we’re doing it is once you get that to the cloud that the database is that it uses to feed, its risk, marketing, fraud, real-time offers and stuff like that become accessible to enormous machine learning. So that you can -- when Mike Mayo is going home on a Friday night, we can offer you -- we know what you like to eat, steakhouse, you eat here, immediately offers and fraud stuff is 10 times what it is today. And so that’s the real value. The value isn’t the immediate cost save that you’ve gone from -- you’re saving $30 million running this application. I want the $30 million. And the other thing that allows you to do is to augment that mainframe system. You touch a mainframe system, you’ve got to be a little careful when you go into it, make some modifications. So, like in the old days, you used to modify that mainframe system 4 times a year, big releases and stuff like that, of course, multiple -- for multiple reasons. Now you can go in and modernize a little piece of it every week, every day. And so, that’s why it’s so important to do this. And it also makes is hard to quantify the benefits and the cost.
Jamie Dimon: I know we got to end this call because we’ve got some of the stuff we got to do. Just for example, is an important one, and Teresa, there’s all the credit for this. We now are using JPMorgan’s investment banking derivative capability to help clients use derivatives for custody to value them and stuff like that. A lot of people simply can’t do that. And of course, believe it or not, a lot of portfolios now, they’re using more and more what you and I call derivatives as part of the portfolio management. That costs time. It costs money. It’s on the cloud. It’s hugely valuable to Teresa having a competitive advantage. Folks, thank you very much for taking some time with us. Good luck to everybody.
