Mark McGettrick: Paul, this is Mark. The earnings impact in the first quarter was about $20 million after tax, because we had a rescheduled -- a refueling outage, excuse me, at Kewaunee in the quarter. And for the rest of the year, although, it's difficult to estimate specifically, we would expect any earnings impact to be immaterial for Kewaunee.
Mark McGettrick: On weather-normalized basis, we saw residential sales up 2.2%, commercial sales up 4%, which is significant. And if you recall, we said this year, our sales growth this year is going to be about 2.7% annually, driven in half of that by data centers. So we're starting to see some of those data centers come in, and so that produced 4% on commercial. Our industrial sales, which are a small piece of our business, are down 8%, and governmental is up, almost 4%. So overall, weather-normalized, we're up over 2% quarter-over-quarter, which is consistent with our projections.
Mark McGettrick: Well, we haven't seen that yet, because most of our contracts are a little longer dated. We also have an ownership position in the ship ourselves. So we haven't seen that come to our -- or looked at that at this point.
Mark McGettrick: No, we're not. This is not a constrained zone, so, we essentially bid in at 0. So that is not going to be impacted.
Mark McGettrick: Yes. Thank you. Just a quick reminder that we'll be filing our 10-Q tomorrow, and for the second quarter earnings release, we're currently scheduled for July 28. Thank you for your attention today.
