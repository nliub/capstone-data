Amie Preston: Thanks, Stuart, and thanks, Matthew, and thanks to all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in L Brands. 
Nicholas Coe: Thanks, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. At Bath & Body Works, we were pleased with our record results during the quarter, building on record fourth quarter last year. We were able to drive solid growth in sales while improving margin rates and managing inventory levels down.  Total sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 8% or $116 million to last year. Comps increased 6% and our direct channel sales grew by 24%. Sales were strong across the quarter, and we were able to drive growth in each of our 3 key businesses, our Signature Collection product line, the soap and sanitizer business and bathroom fragrance assortment.  Our concept of the Perfect Christmas resonated well with our customers, and we were pleased with the acceptance of our holiday assortment, the visual appeal of the stores and the in-store execution of our plans. The momentum from holiday continued with a solid semiannual sale performance that builds on last year's strong sales results. Promotional activity for the quarter was relatively flat to last year, and we were able to execute a plan that included fewer, but more impactful activities that generated a strong response from our customers. For the quarter, operating income was $487 million, up 8% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 10 basis points to 32.1%, driven mainly by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate, somewhat offset by increase in buying and occupancy expense as we continue our store investment program. Operating income for the quarter was negatively impacted by continued unfavorable foreign exchange pressure in our Canadian business. We continue to see strong performance in our BBW Direct channel. Fourth quarter operating income grew significantly versus last year, and annual sales were over $360 million. For fiscal 2015, total sales grew by 7% versus last year and comps increased 5%. Operating income was $858 million, up 16% versus last year. Our operating income rate improved by 190 basis points to 23.9%, driven by an improvement in the merchandise margin rate and expense leverage.  Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2016. As you would expect, we will continue to monitor customer preferences and leverage the strength of our read-and-react capabilities, allowing us to put the right product for full-price selling in front of our customers at the right time.  We will flow newness throughout the quarter beginning this month with our Let's go to Italy theme that features new and seasonal fragrances in our 3 key businesses. Our inventories are well positioned heading into the new year and are flexible enough to react to customer's preferences.  We remain focused on making the appropriate investments in our business, including the necessary increases in occupancy costs in order to continue our White Barn and Bath & Body Works remodel and expansion program. We've been pleased with the results to date of our White Barn format. We ended 2015 with 67 of our stores in the format containing White Barn. Of the 27 net openings and 145 remodels that Stuart mentioned in his remarks, we will -- all will contain our White Barn concept either in the side-by-side or a shop-in-shop format.  And with that, I'll turn the discussion over to Martin. 
Nicholas Coe: The things we could have done differently in '15. Not to jump out immediately, I think we like the way the business performed. We liked our read-and-react capabilities. We were happy with being slightly less promotional, and the mix of the business was healthy. If I think about 2016, it's really going to be about trying to ensure that we continue to grow whilst taking into consideration the investments that we're making into real estate from both the White Barn and the Bath & Body Works perspectives that will, obviously, put some pressure into the business. So really -- and that is really about leveraging 2 things. One is the natural strength -- on the ongoing strength that we've had at the home business. And of course, the necessity to keep the fleets looking as good as possible. So that's really where our attention is going to be, is making sure that top line continues to perform well, so we can continue to afford the investments that we're making. 
Nicholas Coe: It's kind of comparable to last year, really, in terms of the overarching both flow of how we think about how we're flowing merchandise and also probably around the level of newness that we anticipate. There's no major shifts as it relates to sell timing or launch period. There's probably an opportunity to think about how we performed in November, December Christmas time frame or the timing associated with the flow of that. But from a material change, nothing of a significant magnitude. 
Nicholas Coe: Paul, so we're constantly looking at pricing through the lens of both customer acceptance from a product perspective as well as what elasticity we think we have in both ticket prices, while there's promotional price. And as you know, over the course of the last couple of years, we've taken some ticket increases that we haven't had any barrier to. And I think our ongoing goal is always to think about how do we get paid for innovation that we put in, how do we get paid for the newness in a way that gets us to full-price selling. As it relates to whether we think we have power, I think in both our signature business as well as our home business, as we continue to see strength in it, there's obviously opportunity to look at how are we priced and is there an opportunity for either price-up or aggressive full-price selling. And that's typically part of the course in terms of how we actually think about running the business on a day-to-day basis. So price is obviously top of mind for us. 
Nicholas Coe: Marni, yes and yes. So I think on an ongoing basis, whenever we can, we're very, very focused on, one, how do we maximize price point, but also, at the same time, look from the margin gains that come with that. And so we've seen a couple of things work well for us. We've been slightly less promotional overall, playing with the price points, and that has absolutely helped margin. But it's only been -- we've only really been able to do it because of product acceptance. So we think about how our #1 goal is really putting a product out that she likes and trying to get it to full price. And in certain businesses, we've seen a very, very good traction. So we're seeing AUR up, but we've also seen margin, obviously, margin rates come along with that. And if we can't get to that magic place of continuing to pull back less promotion, we know that, that's a brand equity building play for us. 
Nicholas Coe: So yes and yes. So we continue to like the trend of that business. Hence, as we mentioned, we're rolling obviously more of them out next year. Now I want to preface, obviously, that when you hear that kind of number, it's a range. We see a range of all sorts of performances on average. We very much like the performance that's happened, and they continue to be good. And so as we think about 2016, obviously, we've got more stores rolling and our #1 goal is to maintain the comp in the business period and then, obviously, the comp performance that we've seen in those White Barn stores primarily because of the investment that we've made. But yes, we like the results from last year. We like the results currently. And obviously, we'll do what we do really well, which is we'll read and react, and we'll monitor it. So we won't just continue to go blindly if things change. But so far, so good. 
Martin Waters: Thanks, Nick, and good morning, everyone. We continue to be very confident about our opportunity for growth internationally. Our brands are well received wherever we open around the world, and our execution has been excellent. Our foundation is very solid.  We saw a strong growth in retail sales on a constant currency basis across all of our formats in the fourth quarter. However, not all of this growth translated into recognized revenue. Fourth quarter recognized revenue in the international segment increased by 6% and operating income declined by $1.4 million to $28 million. Foreign currency had about a 5 point impact on our recorded revenue growth and about a $3 million negative impact to operating income. We had very solid growth in both recognized revenue and operating income in our company-owned stores in the U.K., in our franchise full assortment stores and in our Bath & Body Works stores. However, the VSBA business experienced a significant decline in both revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter. This decline was primarily the result of foreign currency translation, softness in travel retail and tourism generally and a decline in shipments of beauty products in anticipation of the new Victoria's Secret Fantasies collection being launched in the spring.  In the full year 2015, the international segment revenue increased by 15% to $385.2 million and operating income increased by 13% to $87.9 million. FX negatively impacted 2015 operating income by about $15 million. So absent the FX impact, operating income would have increased 32% and the rates would have increased by 200 basis points to 25.2%. We opened 144 new stores in 2015 to end the year with 531 stores in the international segment, and we plan to open about 175 stores in 2016. At Victoria's Secret International, we are pleased with performance of our full assortment stores. Our London flagship store on Bond Street as well as our 13 mall stores are operating very well, and we'll open another 5 stores in the U.K. this year.  In the Middle East, we now have 16 Victoria's Secret full assortment stores and 3 PINK stores open under our partnership with Alshaya. These stores continue to do well and will open another 12 or so full assortment stores this year, including in new geographies such as China, Mexico, Singapore and earlier this month, in Russia. We'll also open about 5 more PINK stores.  In the VSBA business, we ended the year with 373 locations, about 1/3 of which are in airports. We'll open another 90 or so across the globe in 2016. In Bath & Body Works, we now have 125 BBW stores under our franchise partnerships, and we continue to be very pleased with performance of these stores and expect to open another 65 or so BBW stores in the year ahead. So in summary, despite headwinds from foreign exchange, we made significant progress internationally in 2015, and we remain focused on the fundamentals, which is great execution of our brands wherever we go. 
Martin Waters: Yes, thanks for the question, Ike. So just to dimension how VSBA fits into the segment as a whole, there are 4 businesses, reminder, there are 4 businesses within the international segment. So there's the Victoria's Secret full assortment owned stores in the U.K., the full assortment stores into the franchise business, the Bath & Body Works international business and the franchise arrangements, and there's VSBA. 3 of those 4 businesses have very strong year and very strong quarter. As you rightly point out, our problem in the segment was VSBA. And I'd say there are 3 drivers of that difficulty, as I said in the preprepared remarks, and they're about in equal measure. One is FX, which impacts both recognized revenue and operating income. The second is a general softness in travel retail, particularly people from Russia, from China and tourist destinations that are related to the Middle East and security pressures there have been affected. And I think the -- has been written about widely across the travel retail industry. And the third, which we absolutely own and would take responsibility for, is weakness in our Victoria's Secret beauty business, particularly related to the Fantasies relaunch. And that affected our business globally. To the questions about how we feel about the fundamentals of the business and store closures, we feel very, very good about VSBA. It's a very profitable business, has a lot of runway ahead of it. It tees up the brand internationally very well for us. And we will continue to increase our footprint in that business. The closures, and I think there will be maybe 10, we're guessing, we can see about 5 right now, and we're positioning that it may be up to 10, come from a number of things. One is, on occasion, we close the VSBA in order to replace it with a VSFA. So to put a big store where a small store was, that's good news. That's a really good thing. Second is the nature of travel retailers. These leases tend to be 3-year leases. So just by normal course of business, some of our stores that are 5 years old or more will be coming up for renewal. And other times they're just relocations. So there's nothing sinister in the closure numbers. We have a lot of confidence in the business and the foundations are strong. 
Martin Waters: Yes, I think in terms of growth on international, we're pretty transparent in the analyst pack on Page 15 about where the store growth will come from. If I help to interpret that, the biggest area of growth for us in 2016 will be in the full assortment business. So we will have our biggest year of store openings ever by some distance. And the complexity of that will increase significantly as we're opening in new markets with new partners that we haven't operated with before. So as I mentioned, we have Russia that already opened earlier this month. We have Mexico coming. We have China. We have Singapore. We're actively looking at real estate in lots of other geographies as well. So I think you'll see a real ramp-up in the full assortment store participation of the business. How you model for that, I recognize it's tricky. You've got 4 businesses and you've got 3 different models owned, royalty and wholesale. It's difficult to do. I would say, overall, you should expect our revenue growth to be below that of our store growth as the stores are skewed to smaller stores. And if it was around the 20%, I think that's where I would expect it to be. 
Martin Waters: Okay. Thanks, Richard. I'm glad it's your favorite segment. Mine, too. So we continue to make really good progress in La Senza. We've had a multi-quarter roller coaster comps. Very strong sales performance really driven by being faster to market, more fashion-right, and zeroing in on the customer with a young, sexy, obvious, value positioning. And that positioning is what really differentiates it from both PINK and from Victoria. And in markets around the world where we see the 3 lingerie brands present, we know that they trade effectively alongside each other. They appeal to different customers. And where they appeal to the same customer in different shopping modes and different moods, it's all good. So yes, we're excited to bring La Senza to the U.S. We'll open probably 5 stores in the fall. Our first store is opening in November. Not particularly material in terms of the CapEx as those stores are only 2,000 square feet in space, not particularly material in terms of preopening costs, but very significant in terms of the future growth opportunity that, that represents. We won't get too far ahead of ourselves in claiming victory. It's just a test, and we'll call it over the holiday period, and we'll report back in January. But certainly, very exciting progress for the brand. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Sure. In terms of the gross margin decline particularly in Q1, the deleverage in buying and occupancy is more significant than the merchandise margin decline. Again, the merch margin decline is largely a function of foreign currency, but the B&O deleverage is the more significant component. And the preopening related to Fifth Avenue is the biggest driver of that. As Nick commented on, though, however, we are -- which we view as a very good thing, these investments are good, investing in remodeling Bath & Body Works and location including White Barn elements. So the B&O deleverage is the bigger part, to answer your question. The fact that we're building a global flagship on Fifth Avenue, we view as a very positive thing. And it certainly puts some short-term pressure in the P&L. But for our business, over the long term, it's a terrific thing. It's going to be a great store. And again, the opportunity to remodel Bath & Body and include White Barn in those remodels is also a very good thing, but it puts some short-term pressure on the P&L. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: It doesn't escalate through the year. And we expect that store to open in November, the Fifth Avenue store. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Yes, it's a great question. I mean, as you outlined the question, I mean, getting a sales result better than what's inherent in the forecast, is the most important thing at the end of the day. But we do have other tools in our toolkit. And while there are pressures, whether it's currency or other things, beauty at Victoria's, pressures on the merchandise margin line, we'll continue to leverage our speed tools and work to get some further improvement related to that in our big businesses. And we manage expenses in a tough-minded way. And we're clear minded about growing expenses in aggregates lower than sales. And some of those things we can adjust more quickly than others. But we're not looking to go backwards on our operating income rate, which is what would be implied by this guidance, I realize. But starting with Les and the other leaders in the business, we're not of a mindset where we go backwards on profit rate. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Not so much, to be honest with you, Lindsay. And this change got some good debate within the business and you may have heard me speak previously about some of our views on it. At the end of the day, we were the clear outlier in the industry. And folks, externally, we're trying to estimate what our comps would be with direct in it as everybody else in the industry does. So that's why we made the change. There's no signaling about the trend of our business. There's no significant change organizationally or how we think about the business. We've always thought about the business from a customer first standpoint. And this change in reporting is solely to follow the trend in the industry. We were the only one, as we could understand it, that was not including direct in comps, and that's why we made the change. There's nothing else, nothing else to interpret. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Yes, beauty is an important category for us, as you appreciate, that's why you're asking about it. At the end of the day, it's a very good business. As you're aware, we've made changes to the product line that we call Fantasies, mists and body lotions and body creams. And we think we elevated the product to be more consistent with the emotional content of the Victoria's Secret brand. But there's more work to do to continue to elevate product at Victoria's Secret beauty and to ensure that we get the other elements of merchandising in line with that elevation, whether it's about how it's displayed in the store, how it's sold in the store, it's pricing. We'll be looking at all those things. We are looking at all those things. And we're very confident that we'll get it sorted out. But it's going to take a little bit of time. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Omar, it's Stuart. I mean, the business is performing incredibly well. So let's just start with that. I mean, the merchandising sales growth, the margin results, the momentum in that business, the strength in that business is terrific. As I think we've been relatively clear about over time, the specifics on real estate are largely a function of what's going on mall by mall. Our views about expanding square footage for PINK haven't changed at all. Meaning, we believe that there's substantial sales growth and profit growth opportunity, adding more square footage for PINK, and we'll continue to do that through a combination of remodels and freestanding PINKs. But there will be year-to-year variation in the number of freestanding PINKs versus growth through remodels. That again is a function of mall-by-mall circumstances that are in front of us. So that's how we look at it. And the 2016 PINK freestanding new stores, it looks like we're, as you point out, we're going to open 5 and close 1 for a net of 4. But again, the square footage growth for PINK isn't changing in any material way. Very big growth opportunity for us. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Well, Brian, this is Stuart. As it relates to leadership at Victoria's Secret, first of all, as I mentioned in the remarks, I mean, the business is in terrific shape, as you know. I mean, it's a great brand, coming off record results. And all that comes from a very talented leadership team at Victoria's Secret on the store side of the business, on the direct side of the business. And what that team is focused on is executing fundamentals really well in 2016 to deliver yet another record result. So are there significant holes per se or opportunities, we've got a very good team. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Howard, for Victoria's Secret, the launch cadence, number of launches will be the same, very consistent as compared to a year ago. Obviously, the specifics are different. We don't comment a lot about the details of what we're doing in advance. But in terms of overall approach and number of the launches, highly consistent. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: As it relates to Victoria's Secret, I think it's generally true for the company. I mean, the pricing power starts with the power of the brand and the differentiation that we provide through the brand, through the store experience, through the merchandise. And I would say the balance point, as we think about it, is always being mindful of reinvesting in the product and being thoughtful about driving transactions in units versus rate. And I think the business, including at Victoria's Secret, works hard to strike that balance and has the range of pricing evaluations, including good/better/best pricing and so on. So I think we look at pricing carefully, the particular area that we're thinking about, I imagine a number of retailers are, as it relates to foreign exchange. How does one think about pricing? I don't have any specific comment on that. But you would appreciate that we're thinking about that. But the pricing power starts with the brand and runs with newness and speed, and we try to balance velocity and rate. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Oh, sorry. Depreciation is running with CapEx. So we're investing a lot in -- Thanks, Amie. We're investing a lot in the business, which we feel very positive and optimistic about. And the depreciation increases are really principally driven by the increased levels of capital spending in the business over the last few years. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Yes, at Victoria's Secret, PINK is, we would say, the fastest within the business. But with that said, speed has been leveraged in the lingerie business generally and in the beauty business. But Roxanne, in answer to your question, where is the biggest opportunity, it's on the beauty side of the business in terms of getting faster. And there's work happening to get after that opportunity. But PINK is very fast. Lingerie has made substantial progress and is also very fast, and inherently, a little more complicated given the more complicated construction of its bras and things like that versus the PINK assortment. So lingerie has also made very good progress. And to be clear, I think the biggest opportunity -- we think the biggest opportunity in speed at Victoria's is in the beauty side of the business. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Terrific, terrific business. We continue to make what I'll describe as continuous improvements to the technology for customers doing business using mobile devices. And I think, as is the case in the industry, we're seeing very substantial growth in our mobile business. And we're working hard to make various improvements. We've made some. We'll continue to make some to make sure that's a great experience for customers. Great, great part of the business, that's for sure. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Victoria's Secret thinks about it the same way, I mean, they really do. They've done working the space, they'll continue to do working the space, and Nick said it well, for any retail business, it starts with the quality of the product. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Sure. So we're going to remodel a lot of stores. And you've got the detail of that in the analyst package in terms of the number of reconstructions. And as you would expect, when we remodel those stores, we're looking to make the highest best use of that space. And so our activity has been significant over the last 3 to 5 years in terms of remodeling stores, and we've made progress. And we'll continue to make progress in 2016 with a lot of projects. We obviously wouldn't look to have the full assortment in all stores. So we'll use our business judgment about tiering assortments based on the venue and the sales potential. But we'll continue to make good progress in 2016 given the real estate activity we've got for Victoria's Secret in North America. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: So on Victoria's Secret leadership, Les has always been involved in the business. And as you would understand from our announcements, he'll be substantially more involved in the business. And as things develop in 2016, we'll be looking for ways to simplify and focus that organization. Do we have specifics? Absolutely not. Is that our mindset generally in our business? It is. But in terms of the detail of that, we've got a great leadership team. As I mentioned earlier, what we're most focused on are things that impact the customers. So merchandise and speed and doing things in stores and online well. But certainly, the business will look at ways to simplify and focus things as we move forward. 
Stuart Burgdoerfer: Yes, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, occupancy will be growing at a faster rate in 2016. So as it relates to that part of our cost structure, the leverage point is higher. And then, as it relates to the direct business in terms of its overall impact on leverage points, not a significant effect. The biggest effect is our investment in real estate in 2016 and growing at a high single-digit rate above the growth rate from 2015.
