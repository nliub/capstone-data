James Williamson: Sure, David, this is Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. First of all, just on the property Cat XOL growth that you're seeing printed in the quarter, that's really a premium recognition timing phenomena. And so if you look back at the June 2023 property Cat renewal, which was the Florida renewal, that was really the only renewal last year that we did not grow. And so you're seeing that roll through the numbers in this quarter. All of the other renewal dates that we've experienced recently have shown strong growth. And just to give you some of that perspective, at the January 1 renewal of this year, we grew our property Cat business by 24%, which was just excellent. We did that at outstanding risk-adjusted returns. And then we were able to continue that growth at the April 1 renewal, where we grew globally just about 10% and in our North America property business, we grew property Cat by 76%, again, at outstanding risk-adjusted economics. So it's a little bit of a blip that way. My expectation, obviously, is it will work itself out as we go forward. In terms of the property pro rata part of your question, it's really not a matter of saying, okay, we now like property pro rata better than property Cat XOL for the reasons I just described. What it is, is it's starting really in the back half of last year, we saw just terrific economics in the primary property market, particularly in the E&S space in North America. We leaned into that with our core clients and wrote bigger lines with some of the best underwriters in the market, and that's now flowing into our financials, and we're picking it up in meaningful growth this quarter. And then the other major contributor to pro rata property growth is the expansion of our business in Asia, where we've traditionally been underweight. We're growing very nicely again with best-in-class underwriters in that market. And that market does tend to be more of a pro rata market and very much a property market. And so you're seeing the effects of selecting some really outstanding deals in the Asia market. 
James Williamson: Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Just to maybe reinforce some of the points Juan made, which I think are spot on. We have seen really terrific results from the most recent renewals, including April. And you would certainly have expected, given how much rate the market took last year, that more underwriters are going to be interested in writing the business. And while that's true, we've also seen just a floor under the discipline that people are applying to this market, which is what's sustaining terms and conditions, keeping risk-adjusted rate on the upward trajectory, which is resulting in the economics that we find so attractive.  The other thing to keep in mind is we're still experiencing elevated losses around the world. And while we had a terrific Q1 Cat result, the fact is Cats remain elevated, whether it's weather, earthquake, man-made disasters, et cetera, those things are happening, and I think that's keeping a focus on the discipline that the market is pursuing.  And then the other factor to keep an eye on is we see some really strong increasing demand from some of our best clients. And given Everest's position as a preferred and lead market, we have opportunities to deploy incremental capacity at really attractive rates. And I think that's happening both at the major renewals but also between those renewals. And there's a lot more in that pipeline that I think will help to sustain the market. And so our perspective is, as we roll into the rest of 2024 with Florida renewal in June and then the 7/1 renewal, primarily driven by Australia, we expect discipline to be maintained, risk-adjusted economics should be terrific. And then I would further say that our expectation remains that, that will continue into 2025. 
James Williamson: Yes, Mike, this is Jim. Yes, the -- an earlier question was about the fact that we had printed a lower Cat growth number. You would have seen about a 4% growth number on Cat XOL. And what I had indicated is that's really the impact of the recognition of written premium flowing through the first quarter financials, which included a renewal last year, the June 23 renewal where we actually chose to step back a bit on Florida because of the stringent -- our own stringent financial underwriting approach. And so now that's kind of flowing into the financials.  What I further commented on is that at the January 1 renewal, we grew our property Cat XOL business by 24% for the renewal at really terrific risk-adjusted economics. And then further said, we did also very well at the April renewal, growing about 11% overall, we grew our North America property business at 4/1 by 76%. And so just outstanding growth rates and you'll see that show up in future quarters. 
James Williamson: Sure, Josh. This is Jim. So a couple of things. One, if you look at our gross PML and then further our net PMLs as they've trajected over the last several renewals, they're up modestly. I would say that's being driven more by taking advantage of the property Cat XOL market. We've been pretty cautious on how much Cat exposure we're taking in the property pro rata book. Obviously, it exists, but we're being thoughtful about that balance. I would further say, there's no constraint, given our available capacity, where we are relative to our risk appetite, as you would have seen in the investor presentation, we still have plenty of room to maneuver. And so there's not going to be a point where -- the fact that we've taken advantage of some really exciting opportunities in the property pro rata space, where we then can't go and grow where we want to with key clients on the property Cat XOL, that is definitely not a trade-off we're making. And we would not disadvantage the Cat book for any other opportunity. 
James Williamson: Yes, Josh, it's Jim again. Look, I'm not going to comment on the approach that other companies are taking to lost pick selection. What I would say is -- and this is true of older accident years and more recent accident years. We take a very prudent approach to ultimate loss ratio selection. We certainly did that over the last few years as we've strengthened reserves in reinsurance casualty. You saw us do that. We took a very conservative approach to how we set those ultimate loss ratios and put ourselves in a position to ensure that, that's in the rearview mirror. And then we do the same thing on more recent accident years, which, in some cases, means that we have a different view of the ultimate loss ratio that our clients have. And you would have heard us describe in the last earnings call that we stepped back from some casualty in the -- at the January 1 renewal. We reduced our expiring book by about 15% due to portfolio management actions. And in many cases, that was due to the fact that we had our own independent view of the expected loss pick, and that may have been higher than what our clients expected.  So we're absolutely applying our own disciplines and analytics to what others are reporting, whether they're reporting in their financials or reporting it to us in their submissions and we think that puts us in good stead. 
James Williamson: Yes. Sure, Elyse. It's Jim. Yes, we've recognized written. We don't recognize written premium on a reinsurance contract the way you might on a primary insurance contract where you recognize all of the written premium in the period that you originally incepted the deal. Instead, the written recognition of premium is spread out. In the case of property Cat, it would typically be over a 4-quarter period, whereas something like casualty pro rata is typically recognized over an 8-quarter period and you don't recognize all the premium in a straight line, particularly for casualty pro rata.  And you may recall earlier in the year and last year, we talked a lot about this relative to the recognition of growth from the Jan 1, 2023 renewal relative to casualty.  And so there are going to be these effects. But as I indicated earlier, we're seeing -- we've seen strong growth pretty much at every renewal since January of 2023 and actually going back into June of '22, as the market started to correct. The only renewal that we've had in that entire time that showed a reduction was the June 2023 renewal because we stepped back a bit in Florida because a lot of smaller clients weren't able to meet our quite stringent financial underwriting approach.  So to give you some statistics, we talked about January '24, July '23 almost 25% growth, April '23, 30% growth. Jan '23, almost 50% growth. And it was only June '23, where we actually reduced the book by about 2.3%. So it just gives you a sense of the fact that we are delivering strong growth at terrific economics at all of these renewals. Got a little bit of a blip in this quarter and we expect that to correct.  Now the other thing I would indicate, of course, as you'll see in the financials is earned premium for Cat XOL was up almost 20%, which is much more consistent with what you might expect. 
James Williamson: Yes. Greg, it's Jim. So referencing your question and the PMLs that you would have seen in the investor presentation. So a couple of things. One, look, the peak zones that are represented there, we certainly have seen a little bit of growth in our net PMLs from July of last year to 1/1 this year.  That's a couple of factors. One, we've taken advantage of the market as I've talked about on this call, and we've grown our portfolio at great economics, which is fantastic. We've also optimized our hedging and we're taking more of our Cat risk on a net basis, and that's contributed to the growth in the net PMLs.  Now those particular peak zones that are featured in the investor presentation. We'll see a little bit more growth, I would expect in Southeast wind through the June renewal, assuming that Florida pricing terms and conditions hold, which we expect.  California quake is pretty much in the bag for the year, where you will see us continue to lean into the market at the 7/1 renewal is outside of our peak zones. And so we have plenty of capacity, both in our PMLs and our capital and really any other way you want to think about risk to continue to grow. And I think that's best illustrated by the other exhibit on that page, which shows our earnings and capital at risk and our current position. And you see there that we're -- we have plenty of room to maneuver within our stated risk appetite to take advantage of great market conditions and grow where we need to. 
James Williamson: Sure, Greg. It's Jim again. Yes. So in terms of facultative, we had a terrific quarter in our facultative business. We were able to grow that business very nicely, about 14% over prior year. And that's really on the back of significant demand by our cedents. And in particular, in short tail lines where they had to increase their Cat XOL attachment points last year to manage the market cycle. That means that, in some cases, they're feeling exposed on larger risks. Their per-risk limits might be uncomfortable. And so they're coming to Everest to try to manage that exposure. And so we're getting really great results that we're excited about and I expect we'll continue to lean into.  That said, like all parts of this business, we need to be very thoughtful in our risk management approach. And so there are parts of the portfolio, none of this would surprise you, where we're being very cautious and very prudent. And certainly, commercial auto would be an area where we're being prudent. We've pretty much exited or significantly reduced any exposure to professional or financial lines. We're being very careful about limit deployment in excess casualty. So we are writing some terrific deals there, but we're being careful about limits, obviously, ensuring we're getting paid adequately. So like any business, whether it's reinsurance or primary insurance, need to manage the cycle carefully, but we continue to see really strong opportunities in fact. 
James Williamson: Yes, I think that's right. It is on the pro rata side, it is largely timing of recognition. As we had indicated after the January 1, 2023 renewal, we earn casualty pro rata or I should say, recognized written premium over 8 quarters. And it's really in the middle of that period that you see the largest recognition of premium. And so we're in that period. We had really strong printed numbers last quarter on Cat's pro rata, same this quarter, et cetera. And there have been incremental opportunities, as Juan indicated. And in particular, when those are taking place outside the U.S. and in a very balanced way, we're more than happy to lean in to those opportunities.  On the XOL side, not an entirely different story. I mean, we have chosen to grow in a targeted way with some of our top cedents. But the other thing that you'll see in that line, in particular, which is a relatively small part of our portfolio is that the amount of rate that will be flowing through in that line is going to be elevated. That's our expectation, and that certainly helps to support the growth numbers that you're seeing in the quarter. 
James Williamson: Yes, it's Jim Williamson. Thanks for the question. Actually, for the most part, the acceleration you would have seen some of the growth in professional lines for the quarter in our Insurance business was really related to one large fronting arrangement in our Canadian operation. So it's not really a general trend that you can apply to the rest of our business. 
James Williamson: Yes. Sure. It's Jim Williamson again. Yes, we've been a pretty consistent buyer of reinsurance for our Insurance business. There are a lot of good reasons to procure reinsurance, obviously, it helps us to manage volatility within that line. In a number of cases, particularly our pro rata treaties in North America are quite accretive from a ceding commission perspective. So I think that strategy of using reinsurance strategically to manage our exposure and our economics will continue.  I would expect, as the business matures both in North America and then, of course, over time in our international business, you could expect our net to gross ratio to increase as we retain more of our business. But I think those changes will be modest and will occur gradually over time. So I wouldn't expect any near-term changes in our approach that way. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Yes. This is Juan. Let me start and then I'll ask Mark Kociancic to add some color as well.  I think the most important thing is, really start with sort of the framework, right? So we have been essentially running between the 63% and 64% attritional loss ratio in insurance over the past 2 years. And so there's a couple of things. One, in every quarter, you're going to have some timing and mix noise, but the fundamentals to our approach have remained consistent. And that's really the fact that we have been very disciplined underwriters and we continue to remain conservative with our loss picks for casualty lines in both divisions, not only in Insurance and this is something that we have talked about in prior venues. So we're holding our loss picks longer across all lines of business even if we see favorable loss experience in any given quarter and we're going to continue to do that in a very disciplined and systematic manner. And so that's basically what you're seeing as far as the 64% here in the quarter. But let me ask Mark to add a little bit more on that. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: So sure, Brian. Let me get started, and I'll ask Jim to give you a little bit of extra color on all of this. Look, I think as we've said, both in my prepared remarks and in Jim's question -- answer to David a few minutes ago, we had a terrific 1/1 renewal and we had an excellent 4/1 renewal. So at this point in time, we got close to 70% of our book that's been renewed at what we believe are excellent risk-adjusted returns. The market for us continues to be pretty good. If you think about it from a pricing perspective, you would expect some of the pricing to moderate, given that we've had rate on rate on rate, particularly in some of these geographies over time. But I think more importantly is the fact that attachment points and terms and conditions have continued to hold. And I think that is a critical point to keep in mind going forward for the future. The other thing is what I said in my prepared remarks, which is our competitors remain disciplined. So the trading conditions from that perspective continue to be favorable. But let me ask Jim to give a little bit more color on how he views Florida at 6/1, and then some of the 7/1 renewals as well. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Yes, Mike, this is Juan. So let me give you a little bit of perspective, and I think you can break it down sort of into different lines.  If I look at, for example, commercial auto liability, we have seen essentially rate trend up over, frankly, the last 5 quarters or so with a pretty consistent basis. General liability has done the same for about the last 4 quarters, [ umbrella ] and excess for about the last 3 quarters, right? So that gives you a sense that this is -- it's a trend, right? It's not a fluke, per se, just 1 quarter over the other.  And look, I think the issues in the industry are well known. It's something that, obviously, we have discussed with all of you, competitors have discussed with all of you. So I would expect that, that continues through the rest of 2024. Again, it's 4 to 5 quarters, depending on the line of business that you continue to see that momentum.  When I look at property, there's certainly been a bit more capacity that's come in, particularly into the E&S market, and we saw that in the first quarter. But the pricing is still good and it's still significantly adequate in an excess of loss trend. So we still feel very good about the property business on the primary side of things as well. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Greg, this is Juan. And I would just essentially reinforce 2 points that Mark and Jim have made. So number one, we absolutely see no change to the 17% target. And you see where we started the year at the 18.1%.  But I think the second point is probably more critical one, which is the one Jim just made that we are well within our Cat underwriting appetite. And so that gives us confidence to be able to maneuver and frankly keep growing the property Cat book, given the, frankly, the excellent risk-adjusted returns that we're seeing in that book right now. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Bob, this is Juan. Let me add a couple of comments as well to what Mark just said. I think one important thing to keep in mind is really the hallmark expense discipline of Everest. And if you look at the group expense ratio really at that low 6% range, 6.1%,  6.2%, we've been able to maintain that throughout the entire build-out of that international component because of our expense discipline and our ability to prioritize things that matter and say no to things that don't. So I think that is something you can expect for the company going forward is that we continue to have one of the most competitive expense ratios in the industry, and that, frankly, is not going to change as we invest and build and grow the international component. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Yes. The only other comment I would make and this is Juan, is [ freight ] also had some implications into that as well. But the growth that you're seeing is really what Jim has described, is that fronting deal in Canada. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: No, I don't think we would expect that to continue for the rest of the year. Again, that was due to just one specific deal in Canada. 
Juan Carlos Andrade: Great. Thank you for all the questions and the excellent discussion. And I'll end really where I started, which is we're off to a very good start in 2024, with an 88% combined ratio for the quarter and a 20% ROE. And from the prepared remarks and the commentary that we found over the past hour, you see that we are still in a market with strong trading conditions, generating that 17% growth that you saw overall for the first quarter. And then you certainly heard about the opportunities we see in both Reinsurance and Insurance for the remaining part of the year.  And lastly, we're very focused on delivering our 3-year plan. And I think you've heard from Mark and from us pretty clearly that we still see that ability to generate excess of 17% TSR on an ongoing basis.  So with that, thank you very much, and we'll talk in the next quarter. 
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Juan, just a couple of things to add to the equation. So in addition to the conservatism and the prudence of the lost fix, we feel very good about the margin that we're building in the lines that we're writing. We're obviously tracking loss trend, give you a couple of high-level points on that. Essentially, it's been elevated for a while, for several quarters, but stable, broadly stable, and rate has been meaningfully in excess of trends. So we feel good. No issue on our side to have the extra, what we would call, level of prudence in those loss picks given the loss environment that Juan spoke about and I spoke about during the Investor Day. I do think mix of business will eventually push the loss ratio mechanically lower as we had a bit more short-tail lines to the mix overall. And that should happen throughout the year and a little bit more over time over the 3-year plan. 
Mark Kociancic: Yes. Brian, it's Mark. I don't think it is. I think workers' comp is broadly stable in the last few years. So that's not driving it.  You're right, we had 100 -- roughly 150 basis points of delta last year because of A&H. There is a bit of mix that drove the delta from last year down to something that was sub-63% attritional loss ratio. But I'd say our run rate is more in the 63% to 64% range. And I think what you're seeing here is just a mix of business that is skewed a bit more to longer-tail casualty, and we're keeping those loss picks at a healthy level, a prudent level on our side. 
Mark Kociancic: No. Josh, it's Mark. The answer is no. Despite the large level of growth, very manageable full degrees of freedom to underwrite as we see in the market going forward. No issue on that side. 
Mark Kociancic: Elyse, it's Mark. So you're right. We did start some modest share buybacks in the first quarter, really no change from what we've been saying all along. We're privileging the organic growth, no reason we can't do capital management actions like share buybacks. At the same time, we demonstrated that in March and no reason it won't continue going forward, it's an attractive level. 
Mark Kociancic: So it's -- Greg, it's Mark talking. Let me kind of split this into 2 pieces of PMLs and TSR, ways of getting there. So back in the Investor Day, one of the points that I made during the presentation was that we had lots of different avenues to achieving leading financial returns as measured by total shareholder return.  So it doesn't matter really from our standpoint, if there's pluses and minuses coming from different underwriting markets, pricing and rate. We have a very well-developed and diversified set of franchises to manage cycle management, portfolio management and really drive growth of the franchise, combined with strong investment income. That's unchanged in terms of achieving the target that we set out. PMLs, I'll hand it over to Jim and maybe I'll add a little bit of color at the end. 
Mark Kociancic: Bob, it's Mark. So we did do our Q1 quarterly review process. It's quite comprehensive. You're right, no real reserve studies to go through in the first quarter, but plenty of anecdotal data that we're looking at, all kinds of information. And so after we did a review of not only those years, but really across the board, we don't see anything that's altered our view of our reserve portfolio. So steady as she goes. 
Mark Kociancic: Bob, it's Mark again. So I think it will be elevated for several quarters. So we're adding talent, technology. The premium, as you can see, is growing meaningfully. The earned is trailing and obviously earns in over time. And so we're still in a process of scaling. And you can see, just in the Q1 comparatives, we're coming in for the insurance division of 16.6% expense ratio versus something closer to 15% a year ago.  So our North American operations are fairly stable in the expense ratio. The international is what's got this trailing effect. The good thing on our side is the -- I think the growth is quite accretive. We're seeing very nice technical ratios from the business that we're writing there, diversifies well, good margins that are embedded. So -- and we like the pace that we're going at. So I can see that being elevated for several quarters, but eventually trending down as the scale starts to catch up with the size of the foundation we're building. 
Mark Kociancic: Yes, Andrew, it's Mark. The short answer is yes. I think there are several factors that are going towards that. You heard me in the previous question speak to some of the scaling benefits that we expect to get, particularly from the insurance franchise. So there are several factors, tailwinds that we have that I think will help us achieve that range. I would start with -- we've got a mix that's going to trend a little bit more short-tail in terms of its proportion to the overall book that will come with lower combined ratios. You're still seeing very strong margin that's being added to the portfolio across the board as we cycle manage through the different opportunities that we have. The expense ratio, really the 2 points. So the earned is going to grow more quickly on the international side as it trails the gross written. So that's going to help mechanically when you do the math. And then the expenses as a whole, I think given the fact we've spent over a year, well over a year building the foundation, those benefits are going to start to pay off and expenses will start to level out as an overall ratio. So those factors overall are what's going to drive us back into that 92%, 90% range.
