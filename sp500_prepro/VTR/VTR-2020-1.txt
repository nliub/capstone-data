A - Justin Hutchens: Thank you Debby. First of all, I think it is important to know, our biggest priority is that our operators are looking out for the health and safety of our residents in our communities. That is priority number one, in the near-term.   I will also point two, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have already started to take action, we mentioned the rent deferral in April, we mentioned the opportunity for tenants to pay down rent - pay some of their rent with their cash escrows in May and that the Holiday restructuring.   What we are committed to do is to take action that is going to give us the best opportunity to create value in a portfolio and work with our operators to determine the best outcome. It is still early, some uncertainty ahead of us still, but we will certainly be watching everything closely.  
A - Justin Hutchens: This is Justin. And I'm going to add a little color to that might be helpful and I will just preface this that I'm going to give you April average occupancy numbers that are presented by our operators and these are fully vetted, we only report these numbers.   But I'm going to compare March first. So March average occupancy was 85%, April average is at 82.4%. So, there is 260 basis points difference. If you take New York and New Jersey out, as I did in my prepared remarks when I was using spot occupancy, March average is 85.1, April at 82.9. So, the 220 basis point change.  
A - Justin Hutchens: And I will just add one other point to that. This is Justin. All of our operators are considering the move-in protocols at this point, and about 70% of our operators are operating in states that are starting to loosen their stay-at-home policy. So this is a very active conversation.   And the advantage that testing gives you, obviously it gives you a lot more certainty around the potential for spread of infection. But the other advantage is, it is recognized in the CDC guidelines. If testing occurs, then it can accelerate the time that someone can move in, where the regular quarantine is around 14-days and the testing allows for something closer to two or three days.  
A - Justin Hutchens: Yes. It is actually very low percentage, if you think about around 30 million of rent per month and only round two million or up to two million we think will be paid with the cash escrows s to carry deposits. So not a lot.   I will mention two other things on the triple-net, one is that as we said it is our May collections are really right on track, so looking good in May. Also some of April tenants that took advantage of that deferral have already paid back.   So that was good encouraging sign as well, and in that case, there were smaller operators that had advantage of government assistance. But our tap was to Allow some liquidity for operators during a very tough and uncertain time, and we are happy that some of the operators have taken advantage of that.  
A - Justin Hutchens: Hello, this is Justin. Let me just mention first of all, we don’t normally track deposits, because senior housing particularly assisted living, and memory care are what we focused is need driven. So tracking deposits is usually a very short-term indictor of move-in.   But given the environment we started to track recently a lot of those deposits are in Sunrise and Sunrise has kind of a north east footprint with us. So there is certainly some New York and Massachusetts are few for our Sunrise footprint, a lot of those deposits are with them.   There is another stab I will mention, that is round lead which is something that we do track regularly and leads have stabilized over the past few weeks about half of our lead volume, which is you know encouraging in a sense, because it shows that there is still ongoing demand.   Even though we are not doing physical tours, and we are doing virtual tours and in-lue of those there is still ongoing demand and is ahead of that moving pace that we have been experiencing so far. But there is long answer to short question and that is not ready to really point out specific geographies except to say that Sunrise is a big part of those deposits.  
A - Justin Hutchens: Yep, sure. So, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the year-over-year stats that were down and the reasons for that, given the fact that we are starting off at a lower starting point. I also mentioned the strong sequential performance.   That performance was driven by Atria and ESL. Sunrise was not as big acontributor to that. There are some less good performance from the sunrise portfolio during that time, so it was actually contributing on a sequential basis, closer to down around 9%.  
A - Justin Hutchens: Thank you Debby. First of all, I think it is important to know, our biggest priority is that our operators are looking out for the health and safety of our residents in our communities.

There are some less good performance from the sunrise portfolio during that time, so it was actually contributing on a sequential basis, closer to down around 9%.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Sure, and I'm happy to talk about that and turn it over to Bob, for a little bit more detail. But most of our executive compensation is very aligned with shareholders and is the vast majority of which is in the form of performance based equity compensation.   When you think about the overall enterprise, I'm going to turn it over to Bob to talk about some of the insights he has about making sure that the company is efficient and cognizant of the environment that we are in.  
A - Debra Cafaro: I think that, consistent with the idea that one of the cost efficient, our expectation is that, I would continue to hold those roles, obviously serving at the pleasure of our shareholders and our Board of Directors.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Good to talk with you, Rich. Let me take that. A couple of things. One is we are pleased with the Holiday transaction. We think it really does a lot of good things and we are happy to take a page out of our friends with matrices book, and we preserved that upside in the assets and a lot of operational flexibility. So, we feel good about that and look forward to optimizing that portfolio.   In terms of the triple-net lease, what I would say is, triple-net leases are a little bit like mortgages in one sense, which is that they magnify ups and downs for the operators and in any challenging environment, they are going to be disfavored. And of course that is the situation we find ourselves in now. In other environments, they could be very attractive to both land owners as well as the operators.   So, I think there is many tools in the bag, many I guess you would say clubs in the bag, tools in the toolkit, and the triple-net lease I think will continue to be one. And there are many ways that you can customize leases also to create alignment.   So, we think the triple-net lease will survive and we think we will continue to be creative and collaborative in how we work with our operators, be they tenants or managers in optimizing our portfolio and then being good partners.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Yes. I mean, our investment most, we have a significant Canadian portfolio. Obviously, the pandemic has affected assets there as well. Those operators have also received significant government support and one thing we have liked about the Quebec portfolio with LGM is that they have a younger healthier population a longer lengths of stay.   They are very rigorous and have been very active from early on working to protect the residents. Obviously, that portfolio will be effected as well. But there are some characteristics of the LGM portfolio that make it probably a better performer on a relative basis, despite being impacted by pandemic.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Great question. Yes, the cash and notes are effectively income and I think we mentioned this in the release and so those will be included in net income and yes we actually would expect as part of our ongoing this for ongoing notes we would expect to book and receive some amount of interest income as we go forward.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Right, I mean we have had Holiday in the heat map, obviously and it had been below a 101 and EBITDARM basis. So, as we reported the last time and really what I would say is that just like everything else in the portfolio as you point out, it is really going to depend on how the pandemic really plays out and so I think we will just defer that as we get more real time information about the portfolio. I'm happy to talk to you about it as things progress.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Yes, I mean, I think you should, you should look at about a 0.9 EBITDARM coverage, something like that in the first quarter, rough numbers.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Thank you. Yes, I mean, I think really want to just touch on the fact that, while we are in this period of uncertainty, we generally want to match our decision making speed with what is required. And our Board is going to look at all relevant information when it addresses the dividend, as I mentioned in mid to late June.  
A - Debra Cafaro: And that is shows the difference between really the quote and unquote spot, beginning of month to end of month versus the average occupancies for the month. So, let's carry on. Thank you.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Great. Good morning. So, we are very excited about this initiative and we are taking the first step with Atria and it is really to accelerate employee e-testing at Ventas buildings with select operators to make our communities safer, and facilitate thoughtful reopening and confidence and trust as Justin talked about.   And so, we have this first compliment of 10,000 testing kits with Mayo Lab’s analysis, which is very important, they have a very high accuracy rate at Mayo, as you would imagine and we really think this is a great first step that we can make available. Atria has already done it, ESL will be next and we will make it available to select operators, principally for their employee testing program.   Once we see how that goes again, we are early days are, still a lot of uncertainty, new testing and tools coming out all the time, we will determine if we want to are-up or if we want to take a different step moving forward, but we think this is a great opportunity to do the right thing and really have a differentiated partnership with our operators and really build that trust and confidence with residents and their families that is so sorely needed.  
A - Debra Cafaro: The turnaround is a day or two and it will indeed build confidence as a component of the thoughtful reopening and admissions plan.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Okay. Right. And that is a good point, because the test may also be available for new residents in certain cases. Thank you. Mike.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Well, I will turn it over to Bob, but one thing we know for sure is that, having went through many decades of this that, having assured liquidity is the number one, two and three attributes that you want to have to manage successfully through any kind of uncertainty. And so, we have that and that is kind of a golden rule, and it served us very, very well.   In terms of the pass of the peak, again, there are numerous models. There is a lot of uncertainty, but as of a point in time, I'm glad that you noticed data that shows that a lot of our NOI in our senior housing on those triple-net and SHOP is in states where according to a single model as of a certain day, the peak of mortality is behind us. Now that could change again and that of course would affect our outlook.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Yes, I think that under skilled nursing, I think I'm glad you reminded us that, that we really did that, at the absolute peak time in valuations at a seven cap on rent at that time. And we really continue to believe that was a very sound strategic decision, particularly as we look at infection mortality rates in skilled nursing now.   I think we given all the uncertainty right now we are focused on health and safety as Justin said really just strong effort to keep Ventas strong and stable and get ready for any scenario and the opportunities in the future. So, we will defer that discussion if you don't mind.  
A - Debra Cafaro: I clearly had too many people with the first initial J in my life. Anyways go ahead I will try to get it right this time.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Well, we have talked about Holiday for a while and have been pretty clear about what the performance was over the past couple of years. I think we were in a good spot, because Holiday remains current and paying full rent all the way through the first quarter and they have been great about that and we were the sole beneficiary of the guarantors.   So, of course, we had a EBITDAR kind of one-to-one coverage. So, we felt like we were in a good spot. But we did feel mutually that it was the right time to take a different approach and we did so in a way that we think was beneficial for both and preserved upside and on operational flexibility.    So, we are happy that we have done it, and we are going to optimize that portfolio especially now that Justin is here.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Well, I think our focus right now is really getting through the biggest part of the pandemic Lucas and then there remains really a lot of uncertainty about the depths and then the time period where it will be most active and then what the slope and pace to recovery will look like and those could very significantly affect what the recovery and senior housing looks like.   So, we are really happy for the day when we can discuss that with more specificity in terms of timing, pay and slope. But right now, we are focused on maximizing during the course of the toughest period of pandemic.  
A - Debra Cafaro: You are absolutely right. We are happy that, we have grown our office portfolio in particularly this exciting Life Science University based portfolio over the past years, it is really, you are seeing the benefit of that right now.   Both in the fact that is where all the action is on the virus and the vaccines in the search for a cure, as well as the diversification benefits we are getting from that portfolio, within the broader Ventas Enterprise.   And so, it is a significant capital allocation priority. We do have a number of ongoing projects with Arizona State and [Pitt] to name a few. And basically, what we did as a matter of I think, really good discipline and approach is that, when we really understood quickly the potential from this Coronavirus, we aggressively paused on the two developments that really were not yet significantly underway.   And so the ones that are ongoing are going to be delivered and we will have our 80% pre-leased and the ones that are on the drawing board have been paused I think intelligently to take a look at capital conservation.   And of course, as I mentioned, we will be able to make a decision on those at the appropriate time as to moving forward and timing and the life, we are happy to have this portfolio and it will continue to be an important part of the Ventas’ story.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Well, I would say that we over a long period of time have a good track record of taking action, and that we think is going to be beneficial for our shareholders and we have taken many actions to evidence that whether they have been with Kindred or today with Holiday and we will continue to do that.   We have made a ton of progress, we are proud of what we have done on the leadership front, as you mentioned along with the portfolio front and we will continue to do that with urgency and purpose. And hopefully we will continue to get rewarded for doing the right things at the right time.  
A - Debra Cafaro: I think we have one more operator. Anything further? Okay, if we don't have any further questions, I want to sincerely thank you for your time, your attention, your interest in Ventas. We have a great team here that is really committed to protecting and preserving the Company and for really delivering for all the stakeholders who depend upon us. So, we look forward to seeing you on the other side of this terrible pandemic and until then, stay safe and strong. We will see you soon. Bye-bye.  
A - Debra Cafaro: Sure, and I'm happy to talk about that and turn it over to Bob, for a little bit more detail.

So, we look forward to seeing you on the other side of this terrible pandemic and until then, stay safe and strong. We will see you soon. Bye-bye.  
A - Robert Probst: Sure. This is an analysis Michael, that again pre-COVID that is the analysis of our SG&A. We are well underway in that analysis. Everything I would say is on the table, as we think about that. I would expect to have some more news this quarter as we are well underway on that analysis and we do see opportunity. But at the end of the day, we have a 20-year record of being efficient and effective and that continues to be our goal and we have a duty to make sure we are doing that.  
A - Robert Probst: Sure. I will give you some building blocks Vikram using April as our case study here. We saw move-ins approximately 25% of our historic levels or down 75%, to put the other way. The move-outs have trended pretty consistently with historical patterns and the net of that is approximately a 70 basis point impact on occupancy on a weekly basis.   One way to think about revenue impact is that, and this is the Page 7 of the investor deck. If you haven't seen this is, a 100 basis points of occupancy generally, sequentially on average is about $2 million to $3 million of revenue per month. So, you can do math there.   And we expect that trend as we see it right now to carry on into May. On the expense side, we mentioned about 10% OpEx increase, driven by labor and supplies including PP&E. We had about $125 million of monthly OpEx in our portfolio in SHOP. So, it gives you some more facts if you like to do the math.  
A - Robert Probst: Let me clarify, just to make sure we are on the same page. The 330 basis points was the spot-to-spot effectively beginning to end of April, occupancy moves. And my 100 basis points was simply a rule of thumb to help you.   So, that is an important clarification, beyond what we are seeing in April and early May, I'm not able to project what I think is going to be for the second quarter, for example. But those will give you some building blocks to make your own assumptions.  
A - Robert Probst: Sure. This is an analysis Michael, that again pre-COVID that is the analysis of our SG&A. We are well underway in that analysis. Everything I would say is on the table, as we think about that. I would expect to have some more news this quarter as we are well underway on that analysis and we do see opportunity. But at the end of the day, we have a 20-year record of being efficient and effective and that continues to be our goal and we have a duty to make sure we are doing that.

We had about $125 million of monthly OpEx in our portfolio in SHOP. So, it gives you some more facts if you like to do the math.  
A - Robert Probst: Let me clarify, just to make sure we are on the same page. The 330 basis points was the spot-to-spot effectively beginning to end of April, occupancy moves. And my 100 basis points was simply a rule of thumb to help you.   So, that is an important clarification, beyond what we are seeing in April and early May, I'm not able to project what I think is going to be for the second quarter, for example. But those will give you some building blocks to make your own assumptions.  
Q - Jordan Sadler: That is helpful. I guess I'm trying to understand the difference between, that assured liquidity as it relates to sort of that revolver borrowing or draw downs versus the dividend that you actually pay. So, there is some uncertainty surrounding the potential to be able to draw or have access to cash. But, it seems like you are not yet willing to sort of cut the dividend down to zero in order to sort of stay off or protect yourself from any uncertainty or maybe I'm misreading that.  
Q - Jordan Sadler: I think you answered it. But maybe you mentioned Justin. I wanted a welcome back to him back to REIT land. Unfortunately, under these crazy circumstances, but I would have asked him for a review of the portfolio probably not fully appropriate.   Debbie, a couple years ago, you spun off the skilled nursing portfolio at a time when there was no real distress in that sector. Any thoughts surrounding, management and or the potential spin of the seniors housing portfolio or are we just that way too soon, I don't mean to be flippant at all in that question.

Q - Omotayo Okusanya: Gotcha. Okay. And then on the Life Sciences side, again very strong same-store NOI this quarter, again it has been a positive on the overall Ventas story. So I guess, a little bit surprised when we looked at the development pipeline that is the projects that were halted or all kinds of Life Science Wexford projects and there was one other projects also Life Sciences, where the completion date was deferred or pushed back a year. So, just kind of curious kind of thinking about that business that is such a big positive on your overall story. And again, a part of what is kind of happening on the development front later you know halting or delaying some of these development projects.  
Q - Omotayo Okusanya: Got you. Okay. One more if you would indulge me. So, when Justin was announced as joining the team and you guys announced your kind of plans around senior housing stock outperformed that day. Today, you announced solid plans around Holiday the stock is outperforming. So, clearly, I think the market is looking for you guys to kind of rectify potential issues that people see in the portfolio.   Just kind of given that, I guess why you guys maybe not a little bit more aggressive in regards to kind of trying to address some of these issues, whether it is some of the triple-net portfolio that still has a weak rent coverage and things of that nature, it just kind of feels like the market is basically saying, do it. We are expecting you to do it, but in the near-term it is just doesn’t seem to be happening as quickly as I think some of us anticipating.  
Q - Omotayo Okusanya: Okay that is helpful. Well I just feel like the runway is clearly open and everyone is waiting for you guys to take off.
